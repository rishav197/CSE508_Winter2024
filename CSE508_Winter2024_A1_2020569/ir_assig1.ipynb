After troubleshooting, I solder out the tone control and switched it for the volume pot that seemed to be shorted out perhaps from too much heat from the ground soldering on the back from the factory. Everything worked but there was still hum that I eliminated by running it through an effects pedal. The second one worked but had overwhelming static and hum, but it was cheap. I wired bypassing the controls, plugged it into a separate volume pedal and into an amp. It works fine now but with a little hum. I may still use these in the future because they are very inexpensive. I would use a better and more expensive pickups on better quality guitars. In the future, for one of my inexpensive projects, I would probably just order the pickup without the wiring harness and controls. But, rethinking, even buying an output jack and a bit of shielded cable at Radio Shack would have been more expensive in the end.

You can only adjust it with the tab in the closed position, as opposed to the position shown in the instructions, defeating the easy on/off feature. Also the bracket that attaches the clamp to the cup holder uses a single screw, which loosened up while I was trying to attach the clamp to a mic stand.

I adjusted them a couple of times (not too high) and may have found the sweet spot. I don't change pickups too often but the fat 50's sounded too farty and muffled to my ears. I also like to play a wide range of styles ranging from Jeff Beck jazz to Yngwie Neoclassical to John Mayer blues. These pickups are able to handle those styles easily.

It has enough highs-lows-mids to make you smile.  The sound is similar to pedals costing much more.  Of course, everything is based on taste and the kind of music you play.  This is not a super scooped metal pedal.  It's best for strong overdrives and smooth grudge sounds.  The big factor about this pedal compared to more expensive pedals is that it doesn't like HEAT.  I had a gig in Detroit on a metal stage with a 100 degree PLUS day.  The pedal didn't like it at all.  My BOSS Blues driver was just fine.  Of course the Blues Driver is a $100 pedal. It took the temps just fine. So, that is, in my opinion, the big difference between what you get with JOYO vs other, more expensive, pedals.  Keep in mind, if you are not playing in 100 degree temperatures you have nothing to fear. So, rock on and enjoy your music!!\"], ['Just upgraded to this board and I am very happy I did.

The plastic buckle in the middle of the strap is not removable, so you need to thread that through strap loop and it is a real tight fit. Once installed, the strap works great.

The plastic part that the nylon strap is looped through broke clean off, right on stage. Luckily it was right at the end of a song as I played the last chord, and I held onto the guitar so it didn't go crashing down on the stage. But it could have, I was just lucky.

On several pedals the true bypass switch is loose and on another  pedal the same switch is slightly stiff. Due to the small size of these pedal, I was able to put 11 pedals total on a 12in12in plant caddy after removing the wheels.\n",
            "10 Thank you\n",
            "11 These pedals are great!! A friend of mine said I should buy other pedals because these pedals aren't manufactured by a very known brand name but I went with my own judgement and I was not disappointed with them. I have increased my speed a lot since I've gotten em and I can pedal songs like \"All Nightmare Long\" and \"Beast and the Harlot\" now  =]  great pedals. BUT, it takes time to develop speed so don't think the pedals suck just because you barely get em and you can't go all Jason Costa on em\n",

Unfortunately they are larger than what I would consider a lav mic windscreen. I have found they work best with my olympus me51s lav mic and they significantly reduced wind/ambient noise outside. The colors are nice and help in location them and not misplacing them. I have lost so many small black lav wind screens that if I had a dime...well you know the rest. I included a picture in the customer gallery so you can see beyond the stock photo what you're buying. I would recommend and just mention again, be aware of the size you're getting.\n",

            "18 I have been using these DR flatwound bass strings with a great deal of amazement.  I have installed these strings on two of my basses and I find them to be most excellent for my needs.  For one thing, these kind of strings are not \"fret eaters\" due to their flatwound smooth surface.  Also, they are lots easier on your fingers if you should play that way.  The various tones and behaviors that these strings produce is hard to describe, but it is a situation that very much agrees with me.  You almost have to hear them to really know.  I just got done installing a set of these DR's on a Reverend Thundergun 4 string bass and they sound awesome.  It might be noted that this bass has a 34\" scale neck and string through bridge.  I had no problems with installation or in tuning.  I am pretty much committed to these style of bass strings.  However a word of caution here.  These strings are not supposed to fit long scaled necks.  I shall conclude this review with 6 pictures.  5 stars on these strings for dang sure :)\n",
            "19 This strap is well made and is very comfortable. I installed Dunlop Straploks, which was a chore because the leather is so thick, but I got them on without cutting or modifying the strap. The leather is soft and the padding is nice. I bought another brand of leather strap that claimed it was padded but it wasn't. This strap is nice and cushiony. Highly recommended!\n",

But once set, this small device delivers better than my amp. Was thinking of getting for a friend. I may just do so since it is this good\n",
            "22 My use for a guitar stand is primarily so my guitar actually gets played instead of sitting in it's case.  I love this stand!  It is stable and the pitch on it isn't so great for my Martin DC-15E that it takes up a lot of space.  I like that it doesn't have the higher piece that sits on the neck so it doubles as a decorative piece.  I couldn't be happier!\n",
            "23 So far I really love this tuner. Nice, large Brite screen, it's fully chromatic and your able to change the Hz for non standard tunings, like A 432, which I have actually tune songs recorded in. One issue, don't forget to turn it off as apparently if you don't, it will not shut down on its own due to inactivity and will drain the battery to zero.\n",
            "24 LOVE LOVE LOVE this controller. I use it with the free Serato software for professional gigs. Only downside is the microphone input which does not have much control. It was hard to get the right balance without feedback. I easily fixed this by using my amp input and external mixing board to control the mic levels.\n",

            "27 It's hard to give less than 5 stars because this light is just an amazing value. It packs a serious punch in terms of output and feels quite sturdy. It has a very thin profile and the housing is a thick rugged plastic. Mounting hardware feels smooth and easy to adjust. The display on the back is larger than other lights of this style which is nice when configuring DMX channels. I control mine via a software DMX system, so I can't speak for the built-in modes. It has worked flawlessly in a DMX environment.\n",
            "28 I got these because I hate changing strings on a floating tremolo any more than I absolutely have to.... at first I thought I may have made a mistake because the tone was all off (super bright sounding on first installation).... played for a half hour and retuned, sounded better. Played for another half hour and retuned, sounded even better. Played for another few hours and they sound fantastic. Will update after I get a hundred hours on them (about 50 days from now). Will say that they handle bends very well and dive bombing deep on the trem hasn't hurt them yet.... VERY IMPRESSED\n",
            "29 The first one of these I used, did not work at all. After troubleshooting, I solder out the tone control and switched it for the volume pot that seemed to be shorted out perhaps from too much heat from the ground soldering on the back from the factory. Everything worked but there was still hum that I eliminated by running it through an effects pedal. The second one worked but had overwhelming static and hum, but it was cheap. I wired bypassing the controls, plugged it into a separate volume pedal and into an amp. It works fine now but with a little hum. I may still use these in the future because they are very inexpensive. I would use a better and more expensive pickups on better quality guitars. In the future, for one of my inexpensive projects, I would probably just order the pickup without the wiring harness and controls. But, rethinking, even buying an output jack and a bit of shielded cable at Radio Shack would have been more expensive in the end. You can't beat the price.\n",
            "30 Great idea, but unfortunately the clamp doesnt work correctly. You can only adjust it with the tab in the closed position, as opposed to the position shown in the instructions, defeating the easy on/off feature. Also the bracket that attaches the clamp to the cup holder uses a single screw, which loosened up while I was trying to attach the clamp to a mic stand. I was able to tighten it up, but I needed to remove the bracket in order to do so. Further, even after tightening this screw, the bracket still had a tendency to swivel.\n",

            "34 Easy to fit to my violins top with a good sharp knife and some patience, need to get some better sand paper to make it a perfect fit. Please note this is not a bridge you can unpack and simply insert you must fit the feet to your violins top. Really enjoy the curve of the strings as well. All in all a great step up from the factory fit bridge that came on my instrument.\n",
            "35 I'd give it 5-stars if it was filled-in around the connector (cleaner look and easier to hit in the dark).  Otherwise it was a great solution to cleanly put  an access port on the front of my portable recording rig.  I have lots of USB-A to USB-B cables about, so that connected me to a standard USB audio interface inside the rack also with a B connector.  I already had another B-to-A adapter like this for a USB charging jack that is reversed, with the A-B cable on the inside going to a standard USB charger.\n",

One of our friends got it for us, almost as a joke-- but then we mounted it and realized how handy it was!  It works wonderfully for our little plastic guitar, saves it from getting scratched up in the closet, and looks pretty darn cool.  Highly recommended!\n",
            "37 For the price, these claves sound amazing.  I wanted a natural wood tone as an alternative to the piercing, higher pitch of my fiberglass LP King claves.  These did the trick.  Amazing value.\n",

Please read all the specs on the website description. See a lot of people complaining it doesn't fit their Strat. Well it's because it wasn't made for their model.

Wish there was more adjustability but it is what it is, one of the more affordable stands can't be asking too much.  The back power plug socket on my amp (Bugera v5) barely interferes with the back bar of the stand (bottom of the plug hitting top of the bar) but I got the weight of the amp slightly resting on it and I don't think it's severe enough that it's a danger.  Stand won't be moved around much so  I expect it to last for a long long time.\n",

            "44 These strings are wonderful. My go to strings have been the Gibson Bill Monroe, however amazon does not stock those currently. So I decided to give these a try because they are the same gauge and phosphorus bronze just like the Gibson. These sound just as good if not better than the Gibson BM strings. They are warm, bright and very projecting. They have that signature bluegrass sound that you hear on the classics. I love these strings!\n",

I looked at many vendors for this type of product and because yours ran the full gambit, I chose it.  If you have any that are larger and has all 88 keys, I'll trade with you!\n",
            "49 I bought this to fit into an Ibanez Edge Tremolo. It was a little different to figure out, but once you get it fine tuned and set up right it worked absolutely perfectly. My trem was blocked so I didn't have to worry about it interfering with the recessed route.\n",

            "52 If you want some fun or you are having a down day (and who doesn't some times)...just get this! It is so much fun. Turn on your favorite music and turn this on by simply plugging it on a wall outlet and watch the light show - just fantastic, if you like bright colorful lights. The colors vary and change depending on the sounds from your own music. These are LEDs so very little electricity is used. You can place this table top or hang it on a wall.\n",
            "53 I was pleasantly surprised with this Hankey ukulele. It looks beautiful the neck is great the sound is great acoustic and electrically with amp or pa. Well worth the money worth the money. I'm very happy with my investment. I highly recommend this awesome Ukulele. ;)\n",

            "55 Just what I needed, although at it's lowest setting, wass about an inch too tall for me sitting on the edge of my bed. Ive gotten used to it now so it's all good! Like others have said, it's good quality and sturdy construction. I stubbed my toe on it in The night, and quickly wished that hadn't happened! The rubber grip on top is actually riveted on, so that should last a good while. I also used this for when I practice standing up. I rest my foot on it which pushes the bottom of my guitars out so I can see what I'm doing. All in all its a good product and I recommend it. A word of warning, this is made of strong metal, if you're buying this for your son or daughter, show them the dangers of the scissoring action of the legs. I imagine they could do some hurtin to little fingers.\n",
            "56 This pedalboard is the best value entry level board ive seen on amazon.... Very well made, sits on floor with a good angle, very useful slats and spacing to make cables tidy underneath so you can organise the pedals in a non linear fashion  .  Its big enough to grow into. Love the lightweight aluminum. Velcro straps come with it to strap on your mini power supply (donner psu no less lol).  I also hid my noise suppressor underneath since thats an always-on pedal.  This way, you get even more pedal space on top. I fit all my pedals and probably room for one or two mini pedals or one more regular sized pedal.\n",

            "58 The flute came in good shape, but there are two holes in the under side bottom, toward the end, with both holes connecting to one another at a 45 degree angle.  There's no way to cover these holes and play the flute.  I'm guessing it's a manufacturing mistake, where someone got a little too happy with the hole drilling!!\n",
            "59 It's bigger than I expected and when you pull it out of the box it comes in it has this square shape. LOL. I like it and will hold on to the box just for that. Fits perfectly easy on off. The black area is rubber. I thought it would be foam. Pretty good at wind protection. No popping. It looks good with the H4N Pro. A few loose hairs and sheds a little bit but hopefully all the loose ones with be gone after a little while.\n",
            "60 I would give this 2.5 stars. The reason they disappointed me somewhat is that the squares have a degree of variability to them. See my picture. Some are taller than others, some are more grey others more black. And even after sitting a few days there were still dents in them. They worked but after buying 96 of these I wanted more uniformity.\n",
            "61 This added the je ne sais quoi to my PA sound.\n",
            "62 Fantastic case I got for a great price.  Thank you Amazon for saving me $70 on this one item as compared to Musician's Friend or Sweetwater.  I had several guitars I could use this with but it fit the one I was hoping it would a Schecter OMEN-8.\n",
            "63 Quite possibly the nicest guitar straps on the market.\n",
            "64 I installed these myself using the Elenco Electronics ST-12 Soldering Tool Kit on a 2012 Fender American Stratocaster. I didn't like the Custom Shop Fat 50's that were installed. I wanted something that could growl, that was noiseless but still kept the chime of the king tone and these pickups deliver. I adjusted them a couple of times (not too high) and may have found the sweet spot. I don't change pickups too often but the fat 50's sounded too farty and muffled to my ears. I also like to play a wide range of styles ranging from Jeff Beck jazz to Yngwie Neoclassical to John Mayer blues. These pickups are able to handle those styles easily. Most importantly they are dead silent and that's important when you're doing a lot of recording.\n",
            "65 With a much needed modification, this became a far more durable board.\n",
            "66 Guys, this is a really good sounding pedal.  It has enough highs-lows-mids to make you smile.  The sound is similar to pedals costing much more.  Of course, everything is based on taste and the kind of music you play.  This is not a super scooped metal pedal.  It's best for strong overdrives and smooth grudge sounds.  The big factor about this pedal compared to more expensive pedals is that it doesn't like HEAT.  I had a gig in Detroit on a metal stage with a 100 degree PLUS day.  The pedal didn't like it at all.  My BOSS Blues driver was just fine.  Of course the Blues Driver is a $100 pedal. It took the temps just fine. So, that is, in my opinion, the big difference between what you get with JOYO vs other, more expensive, pedals.  Keep in mind, if you are not playing in 100 degree temperatures you have nothing to fear. So, rock on and enjoy your music!!\n",
            "67 Just upgraded to this board and I am very happy I did. I needed more stereo inputs and this one had 4 of them. When it comes to an internet radio station you need a clean quiet board. I have no noise coming out of this board so I am very pleased. Plus I needed the AUX outs for my TelosONE set up. Everything is working perfect!\n",
            "68 I do wish some reviewers would do a little basic research into what they are buying before posting negative comments. This neck plate is a high quality replacement for the plate that comes standard on newly-manufactured US Strats (and probably Teles). I purchased this to update the look of my '97 \"weird, fat logo\" neck plate and am very pleased with the results. The material appears to be aluminum or aluminum alloy with a chrome finish, in contrast to the heavier steel that it replaced. I did not bust out the calipers but it is at least as thick as the older version. It is not plastic, nor pot metal. It comes with screws. For giggles, I stopped by Guitar Center after installing it and yep...all American Standard Strats have this exact same neck plate.\n",
            "69 This strap is advertised for a mandolin, but I put it on my ukulele. I found guitar straps (usually 2 inches wide) and even dedicated ukulele straps (usually 1.5 inches wide) to be too bulky and uncomfortable. This strap is only 3/8\" inch wide, but my ukulele is so lightweight that I really don't need anything wider and a narrower strap doesn't get in the way of my arms and hands. Installing this strap without removing my ukulele strings took some effort. I had to unthread the strap loop (which is really much tighter than it needs to be), then thread the strap end under my ukulele strings, then thread it back through the strap loop (which is still much tighter than it needs to be). The plastic buckle in the middle of the strap is not removable, so you need to thread that through strap loop and it is a real tight fit. Once installed, the strap works great. The thin soft-ish cotton is more comfortable on my shoulder than thick leather or stiff nylon strap and it doesn't seem to scratch my ukulele wood at all.\n",
            "70 If you're looking for an inexpensive party light, this is a great option.  The beams are pretty tight and is really set off with a fog machine.  The speaker inside was shocking at first (when you plug it in there is a commanding voice talking about bluetooth connectivity.)  There is a little wireless remote that is useful within 10 feet or so.  The motor is a bit loud but with music playing you won't notice.\n",
            "71 I Purchased this unit primarily for sweetening up a violin pickup and an acoustic guitar with an LR Baggs pickup. I'm highly impressed with the improvement in the acoustic guitars tone and character. The parametric equalizer is fantastic for dialing in perfect tone. The unit is dead quiet, the only noise noted was when I tightened up the bandwidth and boosted level into the upper 3rd of its range on the parametric eq. In microphone applications the unit performs equally well and the low cut worked great for reduction of handling noise. This is a fantastic tool at a bargain price. I own an ART tube MP preamp also and this unit is definitely a solid step up from the MP. Thanks to Behringer for making great quality affordable products for musicians on a budget. The only knock I can come up with at this point is that the manual is extremely basic and if you're a new user of mic pre's you're kind of on your own. It would be nice if they had included some application recommendations for basic settings,\n",
            "72 I previously purchased the 20' cable for my SG and Marshall amp, and I was very satisfied. I have a couple of pedals with different variations that I wanted to incorporate, and the old saying \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\" came to mind. So I ordered 2 of the 6' cables to complete my personal set up. You can't go wrong with these. Great Cords!\n",
            "73 Love this stuff so far. Looks awesome and I can definitely hear the difference acoustically. Hoping I don't run into the blue / green issue that other reviewers have seen.\n",
            "74 Love the beefy strings.  Depending on the style of music you play, you might want to give the heavier strings a spin around the block.  If you're on full-tilt distortion all the time, you probably won't see a difference, but if you play without a lot of pedals and like that slightly crunchy breakup to come from your amp, the Beefy strings can make a big difference.\n",
            "75 Another update. How can you sell these to people! I have a craft show this weekend and i went to put these tumers on and none id the screws fit! First one i didn't realize and it got stuck. I had to use two pliers to pull it off and scratched mlthe new neck i just finished making. Your company shpuld not be selling these! I now hqve to run out and find somewhere to but 6 sets ....Update....i ordered more, they came in odd. The top is too wide that the nuts don't fit!\n",
            "76 As I said elsewhere, the pick wears on the edges, and breaks very quickly, within hours if you play hard. I use it on an acoustic guitar with Medium to Light strings, so really! After at least 3 years, I am still using my Dunlop medium guitar pick. The rubber part also \"hangs\" on the low E string, especially if you are trying to hit it for the first beat of the measure or simply for emphasis. This is probably a bad habit, which I could unlearn, but only if the pick would last longer!\n",
            "77 Works great as a guitar bench mat. Not rugged enough for abuse but if you take care of it, it will take care of you. Makes organization of workspace much easier because screws won't roll around. Color is good too.\n",
            "78 I ordered these for my Road Worn Player Tele,  They fit perfectly. no more winding strings and my tuning problems have been resolved!!!!!!!!!!\n",
            "79 Everything met my expectations the product was good quality, easy to install even without directions included and my guitars look great hanging on the wall. I read negative reviews saying that the quality was crap and it took them an hr to get it threaded onto the base. Unless you have no basic knowledge of being handy this will not be a problem just make sure you find a stud on the wall and screw the included screws through the drywall and securely into the stud. Before you do this  run the  screw that attaches to the base through the threads to avoid any issues like the negative reviewer had. After you attach the base to the wall thread in the guitar hanger screw firmly and you are good to go. I personally would easily buy one of these for the price of 2 they are great quality for the price and if you have more than one guitar to hang then this product is a must buy!!!!\n",
            "80 I purchased two of these to hang guitars in my music room. These are well made and certainly do the job okay. However, I completely did NOT trust the two skimpy screws they provided to hang this unit. They are basically drywall screws, but these have a rather skinny diameter. I was not about to trust my vintage P-Bass to a skinny screw inside a hollow-wall fastener. No, I used a heavier \"construction screw\" directly into a wall stud. See photo. I was seriously concerned that the supplied skinny screw would actually break off in the stud. If you are hanging a lightweight acoustic, then the supplied hardware should be fine. I'm probably just being paranoid and overly cautious.  Other than that, I like it (tho walnut piece could be a little bigger in my opinion).\n",
            "81 Great, lightweight product that easily replaces some of my older lighting that's nearly eight times the size and weight.  Having two synced with a DMX cable easily fills the room.  The extra colors not available in many of the big name lights is great addition (orange, purple and white).  Only time will tell how reliable they are.  I'm not a big fan of the white house (which glows), but aside from that, they're perfect.\n",
            "82 Bag itself seems to be nice enough, certainly the stand fits. The strap failed me and broke upon first use, not even with heavy weight in it. The carabiner slipped out of the socket thing. I don't know how to explain it, all I know is I had to replace the strap altogether.\n",
            "83 I bought this bcos it was cheap. The fastener is difficult to unclip due to its tiny size. I have small hands. I like it better if the strings are shorter, so it won't dangle. So far it serves me well\n",
            "84 This is nominally a violin/viola stand, but due to the length and neck diameter, also works well as a mandolin stand. My Paris Swing mandolin fits nicely into the Auto Grip holder. An added bonus is that my Irish bodhran (18\" frame drum) rests comfortably on top of the Auto Grip assembly, with the bottom of the rim resting against the padded legs as does the body of a stringed instrument.\n",
            "85 This thing kicks some serious butt. An excellent, deep, thumping subwoofer. It really rounds out our sound. The first day I got it I ended up with a sheriff in my front yard asking me to turn it down. :)\n",
            "86 Perfect fit on my Epiphone LP 100.... My beginner guitar.  Had to decide if I wanted to sell my LP-100 after upgrading to an LP Standard.  Decided to keep LP 100 for sentimental reasons but wanted to get rid of Cream colored trim.  Swapped out cream colored pick-up trim and the poker chip for Black ....love it\n",
            "87 I manage a classic rock band. I recently ordered a bunch of stuff to replace aging gear. Cables, mics, stands, snakes, etc. We have now been out on a couple of gigs with the stuff. It is all good quality and working fine. Does exactly what I expected it to do. No surprises. In the interest of time I am applying this exact same review to all of the items I bought for this purpose and am happy with. FWIW, I am also taking the time to be critical of the items I am not completely happy with.\n",
            "88 this pedal is for marshall amps it with a e.q. and compressor made a awsome metal skull ripping tone I was thinking of a voodo mod but a friend told me about the pedal and man its got more than enough gain  i mean lots of distortion it and eq compressor makes for a great combo  so get rid of all the tube screamers and go to the turbo rat if you got a marshall\n",
            "89 Competitors had detailed drawings and better pictures causing me to worry I'd made a mistake with these. Luckily, when I tried to cancel, I was too late. These dandies hold the pickguard firmly and even better-the correct countersink, satiny color & flatish profile make them nearly disappear into the pickguard. PERFECTION!\n",
            "90 There is not any noise during use, and not heating with 8 pedals powered on running for 5 hours, the voltage of each channel keeps the same. Stable power supplying. With 7 X 9V 100mA +1 X 9V 500mA+1 X 12V 100mA+1 X 18V 100mA can work for at least 10 pedals easily. 10X50 cm cables are long enough to reach any part of the pedal board. Small size, and will not taking up too much pace. The Polarity Reversal Cable can help you cope with different pedals. Stable output and cost-effective. Provides 10 power outputs, it is able to work for a standard pedalboard. But the price is not so expensive as the Voodoo Lab or T-Rex, etc, you can easily have a power supply to work for your own pedals. I am quite satisfied with the price and stability overall it is very worth having. NO HUM! EXCELLENT POWER! GET ONE!\n",
            "91 For the money this pedal is great but you really need to use a noise gate with it, the background hiss is almost unbearable when when activated and not playing.\n",
            "92 I didn't realize they were so short, but they still worked perfectly.\n",
            "93 Bought it as a gift for my brother, but got to play around with it for a couple of days. Sounds great, doesn't go out of tune too much, but I read that is normal in new instruments so no worries there.\n",
            "94 Tiny little amp. I have never seen these in my retail shops. I just ordered from here. After putting in a 9V battery and plugged in my Gretsch guitar, instantly I heard the punching sound of rockabilly. Never did I ever heard any strange sounds of feedback or popping or screeching. It was quiet and perfect for me even when I played it real close to the amp. I did not purchase the DC adaptor, just relying on batteries. Imagine I could play electric guitar in my car, how portable is this thing! The bad thing about this is that the box packaging looks cheap and printing was bad. The brand name of the amp is located at its back, kind of shy of telling others it's Fender. At first I suspected it was fake. However the sound doesn't lie. I realized this amp cost more than the others, not sure if other brands are equally good as well.\n",
            "95 This happened (check out my picture) in about 3 to 6 months of use. I guess you by cheap, you get cheap results.\n",
            "96 No the best sound but for practice along without disturbing the neiborhoods is the cheap and best option...\n",
            "97 I LOVE this thing. It works as a VOLUME pedal, WAH pedal and EXPRESSION pedal, all in one. Also, the WAH sounds amazing. The small size of the top plate makes it a breeze to use and pull off all kinds of things that are much more difficult with a full size wah.  In short, it's built like a tank, sounds amazing and looks great :)\n",
            "98 Don't care what anyone says, these things are great. I've completely upgraded my lighting with just two of these. Nice and bright, easy to setup master and slave and very durable if treated with care and properly stored/transported.\n",
            "99 This would be my fourth Ocarina Wind ocarina. It is by far my FAVORITE. I love the \"Sound of Earth\" design. The mouthpiece is perfectly sized. The body design is very comfortable and feels natural to hold. The rough finish makes it feel sturdy and adds some nice grip! The slight indent at the subholes makes it very easy and comfortable to use them. (My trumpet creeper ocarina's subholes are a pain, and the \"rythym of the earth\" are a little close, I am always hitting them on accident!) It is also the most in tune, all notes! It has a great, mellow but resonating sound. I would love to see more aesthetics with this body design! I truly was surprised. I have 3 other ocarinas from them that are more than reasonably priced for decent product, but this one in particular blew my expectations out of the water! I definitely recommend this for any level, especially beginner at this price. It is worth much more than what it is being sold for! I actually bought another!\n",
            "100 All I have to do is install this on my Strat. Instructions gave me a good idea of what needs to be done, and I have experience with all kinds of stuff since I was involved with all types of Proto-Typing in many different machine shops so it should be a fun project.\n",
            "101 I play guitar with a flat pick. But I also play ukulele, and hard picks can make the uke sound a little harsh. I've tried felt uke picks, but they never felt comfortable. So I use one of these Alaska Pik Fingerpicks over my index finger for strumming. Size is important. I have medium sized hands, and these picks can slip off my fingertip when it's hot and muggy, like when I'm playing at an outdoor market. That can cause some awkwardness when trying to strum, sing and keep the pick from flying off my finger. I might try the next size smaller in the future. But this is the best pick I've found for getting a loud, round sound out of my uke.\n",
            "102 I absolutely love these!! I bought these colorful wind screens for my karaoke microphones. I have received many compliments from family and friends!! Definitely worth the price. It took a little while to get here, but worth it!! I noticed other reviews stating they didn't get the same colors as pictured. I received the right colors!\n",
            "103 I have always hated tuners; I would rather use tuning fork on the A string and go from there. Most tuners are too cumbersome and require large batteries or external power(pedals). In addition I couldn't use those on my acoustics. Snark solves all of these problems. The display is colorful and easy to read and hides neatly behind the headstock. There is also a visual tap metronome that shows a beating heart in sync with the tempo. I can easily move it from electric to acoutic, and Amazon's pricing is so low I am considering getting one for each of my guitars. This is one of the few 5 star ratings I've given any product on Amazon and I rate a lot.\n",
            "104 Excellent product fit perfectly in my Epiphone pr-5. I think it did change the sound a little bit, it has more sustain. Very nice look.\n",

            "107 This microphone is durable, loud, and clear. I got this to improve the sound of the Blowing Up podcast and it did wonders for cutting back on noise.  I've also used it for live sound and actually like it more than my SM-58.  It also looks and feels very nice, if you care about that.\n",

When I unplugged it, the actual quarter inch end broke off as I was pulling the cable out as I normally do at the end of practicing or a show, and got stuck in my amp so thanks to this, I have to spend money and time that I don't have to get my amp fixed with the broken cable and buy a better, stronger, more durable cable that won't break when I pull it out of the amp.\n",
            "110 I love this guitar. You can have a clean tone or a crunch tone which is perfect for what I play. It was my first bass and I got it at a local used gear shop.

            "113 Have never tried these before- just put them on two of my basses. I usually play a set of strings 'til a string breaks- so a very long time. After about a month of playing they still sound fairly new, I think they sound good, feel good, and have even response up and down and across the fretboard.\n",
            "114 I have to give these pickups 5 stars for bang for buck!  I bought this last year for an 96' Korean Squire that I have been slowly but surely replacing everything on as a learning project.  Time marched on and I finally put them in tonight and all I have to say is Wow!  The difference in these and the originals is just off the scale.  I never realized how much amp hiss I was getting until I plugged these in for the first time.  I had to actually hit a string to make sure it was working.  I can not say enough good things about these affordable pickups.  I have another MIM strat with some boutique pickups that are marketed as noiseless but I honestly believe I actually like the tone of these better for a fraction of the cost. If you have an old Strat laying around these are the pickups you need to bring it roaring back to life.  I have attached a pic for those who wonder how the covered pickups look installed.\n",
            "115 Bought these for my Peavey Raptor Plus EXP that I'm currently rebuilding. The screw was a bit longer than the one that was for the original string tree, so it took a bit longer and had to use a little bit of elbow grease to fully get it screwed it. But once it was tight, it looks great and matches the rest of the gold hardware on the guitar. I would recommend this to anyone looking to build a Partscaster, upgrade the string trees, or do as I'm doing and getting all gold hardware for their guitar.\n",

            "117 I bought 4 to use for my pedal board that I just made. Upon opening the first one, it was not one continuous piece. It was cut towards one end and as I unrolled it, a shower of the black mushroom nubs came falling out (see picture). Hmm...maybe just a bad roll. I opened the second one. This one was one continuous piece, and only a few nubs fell out. Ok, lets test it out. I attached it to itself and pressed it together. Nice grip. Then I pulled it apart, and several bunches of nubs came tearing out as well. If I'm going to attach something to my pedal board that will bond permanently, I don't want  something that will tear itself apart and leave bald patches every time I move a pedal. I'm sure it would work fine, if you don't move things around, but just the idea that I can't do it do often doesn't sit well. Oh well, expensive lesson learned. Get the 3M instead. I have used it in the past. Good stuff.\n",

I didn't think this was possible, but I actually found a product MADE IN THE USA !!!  I will definitely buy more of these as my guitar collection grows.\n",
            "131 I purchased this SSL-1 RWRP to use in the middle position of my MIM Strat that I converted into a poor man's version of the David Gilmour black Strat and am very happy with the tone. The only negative is that it doesn't come with a cover.\n",
            "132 Finally a cheap neck that is as advertised!!!\n",
            "133 This tenor ukulele case is great. Love the color (red) as well as the burgandy colored padded interior. This case is very sturdy and well made. All four latches close securely. There is an extra piece of removable padding on the inside that I placed along the side of my ukulele for a very nice, snug fit. I was looking for a hard case that had a pair of backpack straps, which this model does. I don't know if all the colors have that, but I was told that the red, white and champagne colored cases have the removable backpack straps. The straps are also nicely padded. Really if there was anything I would find fault with is that it is a rather heavy case, being fiberglass. But that's a price I'm happy to pay for the bombproof security this case affords my expensive Pono ukulele.\n",
            "134 This was an eBay buy to flip. Not a bad Bass guitar. Just not worth much, used or new. The bridge pickup is very noisy. The pickups are not an active pickup. If they were an Active pickup without the BOOM sound, then I would say its a 4 star. Everything is about the same as the GSR200 as far as body, neck, and bridge. Mine was a $79 buy new and a $119 flip. Its an ok Bass guitar after a string change and a setup. This is more of a first time Bass buyer who is learning to play.\n",
            "135 This black guard fit perfectly on my squier affinity telecaster that I was doing my rendition of macawber(Keith Richards telecaster). Very impressed with how well it was made. I just had to file out the pickup hole just a little bit for it to fit with ease. But all mounting screw holes lined up and I didn't have to do any fit work that you have to do most of the time, even on more expensive pick guards sometimes. I am very happy with how it looks and fits, I do really like the matte finish of it too.\n",
            "136 I'm using this brilliant connector from my iPad retina (running a sequencing app) to a Roland MC-303. Works perfect. Having this connector opens up a whole world of new tech and old tech compatibilities. I'm sure it works great for using USB controllers for Midi as well, since that's really what it was designed for. If you are looking to incorporate your iPad into Midi world, get this now.\n",
            "137 I bought It to replace my Squier II's bridge, It has improved the resonance and sustain, the item was described as \"Mexi\" so I thought It was made in Mexico, but It's made in Taiwan... Anyway It's a genuine Fender part and now with a few dollars my guitar sounds better.\n",
            "138 I'm a long time musician, and a long time user of Ernie Ball Strings (on electric guitars). Unfortunately, I can't endorse these strings, even though they sound great and the light gauge saves my fingers. The problem is that they break, in my humble opinion, excessively easily. I put a set on and broke a g string within 2 days of moderate use. It snapped near the saddle, so I didn't think much of it. I replaced the set, and within a few more days I noticed that the wrapping on the g string was broken and becoming unraveled near my third fret. I bought 7 sets, so I still have 5 more sets to go through, but honestly I'll probably go back to elixirs when these are gone, since they seem to last longer.\n",
            "139 This is legit everybody is may only be 20$ but it's plug and play no special knobs or knobs just get your phantom 48v and your ready ... This is used for like the floureon mic or the Neewer mic or the Tonor mic they all work with this\n",
            "140 As I am sure that you know, this is a Fulltone OCD clone and let me tell you that it is the closest to a perfect clone in sound as you can get. I love this pedal and because of this one will probably be buying many more Joyo products. I wasn't a huge fan of the paint job on the product so I pulled it apart and used ceramic resin engine paint to coat it. I love this pedal and would recommend it to anyone!\n",
            "141 We installed ours at the heel of the neck having ordered extra guitar strap buttons. My wife loves it on her new Alvarez AU90T tenor uke. She immediately contrasted the soft cotton fabric with an old synthetic guitar strap I had pulled out.\n",
            "142 I bought this bag for my double kick pedals.  It's a great bag for that purpose.  The pedals fit perfectly, and the fur lining helps protect them .  The exterior pocket is perfect for the beaters, link bar, and any other accessories you need.  I would highly recommend this bag to anyone looking for an inexpensive way to transport and protect your double pedals.  The only thing I would like to see added to it is a divider between the pedals.\n",
            "143 Fit my 2007 MIUSA Strat which I purchased gutted and I'm slowly getting parts for. I just got the switch and machine heads and I still need the Pick-Ups. Since it's an 07 I felt that I could hot rod with out getting ostracized for it. I'm also going to do a hand carved inlay on the body. The guitar is being built for a give away to commemorate 19 years serving Indie Music. The image is a 1977 Fender MusicMaster MIUSA, the part I got is the same going on a Fender Strat\n",
            "144 Very sturdy , easy to set up and take down . If you need a light stand and price is an issue, I would recommend this product.\n",

Most reviews I've seen recommend new strings and a different bow, neither of which I had. The bridge was already set in place. So, on Christmas morning, she popped in a 9v battery, tuned it up with the existing strings, rosined up the bow that came with it and plugged it into a small amplifier, which resulted in the attached video.\n",
            "146 You can do a lot with this mixer. its great for podcasting. has 4 outputs that can be used to monitor, record, cue audio...The mute to 3/4 figure on every channel is fantastic and the three source switch to headphone/control room is a must for podcasting. Also has aux return inputs that can be used as extra stereo inputs and be volumed by the aux return knobs.\n",
            "147 These DR's sounds great! Looks good on my MusicMan Sterling Ray34 Bass (Will be back with update review) Update: After playing for an half an hour (4 times out of the week) G String went dead, followed by the D ...I'm going to try the new Rotosound NXB45 Nexus Bass Black Polymer Coated Hybrid Strings (Good Reviews)\n",
            "148 The quality of this bass trap is amazing. I record all kinds of music and when mastering a song with heavy bass leads I need to hear it as clearly as possible. This works perfectly. I have trouble hearing someone speaking on the other side of the room. I may have over done it, but the room is so muffed from any sound its almost erie... Well worth the money! By the way, when I'm not recording I use this room to play Xbox One on. The bass is so crisp and clear. Its better then a movie theater!\n",

            "150 This light is awesome!!! Very bright with 54 one watt diodes. Throws a nice medium wash they are great. The only down side I have with them is a power cable being attached to the fixture instead of an iec cable. It has dmx in and out. The housing is a very tough plastic and also includes the hanging bracket. The par is a flat par which is great for up lighting. I think this is a great fixture so I give it a 5 stars\n",
            "151 Simply beautiful. Excellent quality. It is a bit long since Im only 5 and play with my guitar fairly high up. I just cinch it as much as itll go and its just right.\n",
            "152 Arrived in 2 days with prime in safe packaging. Minor paint flaws with semi gloss finish. Plywood and plastic construction with painted plastic fretboard. Has plastic tuning keys and metal tuning gears on headstock. Paint wore away quickly on the side of fretboard at the top of the neck. The strings on the ukulele are not of quality but the ukulele can take brand name strings and tune them correctly. The bridge and nut need filing in order to effectively play chords or scales so I would consider it a novelty uke. Perfect for a toddler or young child to use instead of an expensive instrument, but will not be good to learn on or take lessons with. False spruce top and stained mahogany back and sides give it an expensive look that kids will love. Adult supervision required as there are moving parts. I bought this for my son who is turning two years old this May. See photo for comparison of an acoustic guitar (spruce top, catalpa back and sides) vs. the soprano ukulele\n",
            "153 Very nice product! Really really love it! I hope these last long time! Highly recommended! Better effect with a fog machine!\n",
            "154 This is a great idea and I was surprised at how well the suction cup adheres to my guitar's surface.  However, if you are going to rely on it for a gig, then I would attach at least two as your hand or any brushing against something firm can knock it off.  In other words, it isn't as sticky as adhesive.  But, for most situations, it certainly does the trick and can removed in an instant and does not deface the guitar surface in any fashion.  It does come with a medium thickness, pink pick that is halfway decent.  While I am not crazy about the color, I quickly realized that it is easy to see against the strings and surface of the guitar.\n",
            "155 This thing works great. I hooked it up to my ATR2100 along with a NEEWER scissor arm (without a shock mount) and I did some tests to see how my plosives were. It makes a great difference, especially since you have to get pretty close to this type of microphone (dynamic). It may be a cheap buy, but it's definitely quality and does what it needs to.\n",
            "156 Gamechanger mixer. One of the few things that has been made in this century that is decent. I use it in a studio rack that replaced a Mackie 1202VLZ, a Yamaha REV500 DSP and a Behringer 31 band DEQ2496. Was a little reluctant to replace all these devices, but over time I gave in as I learned/experimented more with this mixer. I control it with an IPAD Air 2- prefer it over Android as I can place the RTA, the EQ and the channel strip all on the same screen without having to toggle. My only small gripe is that updates and development of the IOS XAir app have not been much of a priority (2 years between 1.42 and 1.5?) . It can be a little overwhelming- after 6 months, I'm still learning more about it and that's a good thing- they'res stuff I can do with this mixer that I could not do with any analogue mixer I've had/used. Love the idea that I can take the IPAD and roam.\n",
            "157 All I can say is I'm loving it.\n",
            "158 I installed a set of these on my Epiphone G400 Pro. They offer better prevention of guitar straps slipping off than the stock strap buttons provide. These pins also have a lower profile than the stock pins. They are a single piece pin, versus strap lock that have two pieces that lock together. Installation was very easy and the provided hardware fit with no issues. These strap pins give me piece of mind and they look awesome too!\n",
            "159 This USB guitar/instrument cable lets you connect an electrical musical instrument to a PC directly through the USB port. This takes a few minutes to auto-install the drivers when you plug it in. Once installed it worked smoothly. It seems to be solidly constructed and it fits fine on both the USB plug and the guitar. Take note that it was listed on my computer as a headphone device rather than an instrument cable, so don't get confused by how it is listed in the USB devices. I would say this is worth trying if you want a USB musical instrument cable. I received a discounted sample for my honest, unbiased review.\n",
            "160 IMO this is the best and only way to mount toms, especially Pearls.  My Session kit came with them and with the heavy 6 play maple toms have never had a single issue with tuning, bouncing, lug stress whatsoever.  I think after you use them for a while you can take them for granted and don't fully understand how sturdy they are until you use another suspension system.  I recently purchased a Pearl Birch Vision kit for my wife which came with Pearl's I.S.S. mounting system.  To be fair I've never used them, and in the case of the new kit they came right off, and the Optimounts went right on.  Even though these are not the aluminum (more expensive and slightly lighter) Masterworks version, I feel they not only work for what they're intended, but they also accent the drum shells without being intrusive.  Most drummers buy, skin, and play for sound, but showing off your nice wood shells never hurts.  I can't think of a single negative, except that they're not free.  :)\n",
            "161 I'm going to give this a five stars.  It may feel fragile or not strong enough ones you open the mail, but it's a very good product and feels strong, ones you install it.  That's also easy to do.  Check out the pictures I posted. I'm happy\n",
            "162 This stuff cleaned up and made my Gibson songwriter shine like new.  Thank you very much,  Chris\n",
            "163 It's very nice. It can hold my Casio px160 even with the stand on.\n",
            "164 Hey hey\n",
            "165 Quality of sound is good. My only problem is bottom part of the amp is peeling off like in the picture in about 2 years. I never took the amp outside nor put it on the floor. Always kept in my room on the amp stand. Also I'm not a heavy user of the amp I just practice once a week or so.\n",
            "166 I love this guitar! I honestly never held a Squire brand strat before, but compared to everything I've held, played, and heard in the past; this guitar really gives you the best bang for your buck. Especially if you're like me and pretty much poor as dirt. I thought that with this guitar being so cheap I'd probably want to get some small upgrades, but I'm pretty content with what I got after the first 10 minutes of playing.\n",
            "167 Very sturdy and professional boom arm. Worth the money and definitely built to last.\n",
            "168 These SKRIMS are a little bit pricy but they are simply awesome, a friends band borrowed mine to impress a club owner, They will be buying these soon. They have a hook at the top that slips around the tightening screw on your speakers and with a par Can light underneath these are simply put.. Impressive!!!\n",
            "169 Hold 3 guitars by the neck. Height can be adjusted and it can support weird shapes.\n",
            "170 I must have have gotten lucky? All mine are gorgeous, and with a tweak or two, bridge tweak, neck twea k, string height tweak, I am still in shock that a vintage , large headstock, 50's style Strat...the look, finish, and playability are rare in discounted axes! Hey, each and every piece screams FENDER. My studio wall is very, pinkies up! ...classy,  so much, for so little!\n",
            "171 I like Tascam products. I have a rack mounted digital recorder, a CD player and a small digital recorder. The 100mkII is also a very good recorder but I have some complaints: The battery life is short maybe because it uses only 2 cells. The volume control is very close to the phone jack making adjustment a bit dificult. The door of the AA cells seems the door of a cheap toy; it could be more robust. Apart from these minor details I'm well satisfied with the product.\n",
            "172 These wall hangers are superb. I don't understand why others of inferior quality cots twice as much. These are made out of solid wood (looks like Pinewood) glazed over with weather protective urethane. The great thing about this is that it supports all sizes of guitars, from small Ukuleles to full size. That is due to the rubber rings which they include to avoid smaller necks falling out. Another very nice thing is that the arm is screwed into a wood nut, which makes it super secured while allowing for movement in case you have odd neck shapes (like fender strats) which require a little angle.\n",
            "173 Purchased the 5-hole pickguard in eggshell for my MIM Baja Telecaster. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much since I hated the cheap, white plastic version that came stock. Black Bakelite looked good, gold anodized aluminum looked better, but somehow this one just seems right. It's a heavy, vintage thickness, rigid, and very high quality. The eggshell color adds just enough warmth as well. There is no shielding so you may want to slap some copper foil on the back.\n",
            "174 Perfect Fit!! Color match is very close.  Great product!! Added pickguard to a Les Paul Studio Deluxe..\n",
            "175 Good quality for a fair price, but it does indeed sag with heavier weight needs support. I placed 2x20# on the shelf and it sagged about 1/4. Overall a good product. If tasked with supporting small weights, it will likely be a perfect choice.\n",
            "176 The kit shipped the following day from the distributor after my placing the order, arriving ahead of schedule. It took me a couple of hours to set it up and position the components to my liking. Adjusting the sounds, tones and volume of each device was rather straightforward. For the price, I am pleasantly surprised with the action of the cymbals and pads. Sounds great when recording as well. I highly recommend this kit for someone who doesn't want to spend a fortune, but would like a functional, professional-sounding electronic drum set that can take a beating and not take up a whole lot of space. I drum left-handed and placed everything accordingly. High-five to Acorn.\n",
            "177 aloha from hawaii!  it's 2015 and after 58 years, my '57 Fender P-Bass has a new case! the Fender P-Bass fits like a charm!\n",
            "178 My Tele is perfect, thank you very much.\n",
            "179 This is a good stand for the price. However, the mandolin seems to sit on the floor and this supports it.  Its good that it's on a rug, but I wouldn't place this on hardwood directly if you are worried about the finish of you instrument.\n",
            "180 They work as advertised,chords and notes are loud and clear without the interference of other strings vibrating...Wow!! Want a set for my 6-strings as well.\n",
            "181 I needed an inexpensive set of tuners for a low budget bass project and these fit.  While the lower quality does exhibit itself during tuning, they do work.  As long as one doesn't expect quality at this price point, they do the job.  I've had them mounted on the bass for about a month now, and they don't hold the tune as well as Hipshot, Grover, or other quality tuners, but I am happy with the performance at this price.\n",
            "182 I've had this tuner for about 4 years and it's been great. It tunes fine. For a long time the tuner just sat in my room, but recently I started taking the tuner around to practice and transporting it in my bag. Unfortunately one of the 3 plastic pieces where the gooseneck attaches to the tuner broke off. It still works but the head sometimes falls off of the tuner. Now I'm looking for a clip on tuner that is a little more durable. If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know.\n",
            "183 I'm using several of these on a wall I built. The hangers work great with several different head-stock shapes. I wish there were available bands, straps or locking devices to keep instruments secure here in earthquake prone California. I ended up using velcro strips under the hangers that affix over the fretboard. Otherwise a great hanger..\n",
            "184 Perfect for my EC-1000S EMG. Been using D'addario for years and they never disappoint me. Even on a shorter scale guitar there is enough tension to keep them tight.\n",
            "185 The normal adapters to be able to mount an Apogee MiC onto a regular microphone stand are about $20 for a made-for-the-purpose one or about $10 for a camera adapter which can be made to work (kind of ugly looking though, in my opinion).  What I did was to buy this adapter for less than $2 and then I ground off flush the screw stem on it.  I then used a small 1/8\" drill bit to drill a hole large enough to allow the Apogee's OEM tripod's screw to be able to attach this adapter to the swivel adapter part of the factory Apogee tripod.  Sounds complicated but it was super easy to do, works great and saved some money.\n",
            "186 For the money they aren't bad but that doesn't mean they are good. Loud highs and lows get fuzzy and the over all doesn't sound great but for a small gig band or a backup Mics these are great! The only prob I have with them is that the mic mount doesn't fit on like any mic stand I have AND BUY A CHEEP POP FILTER FOR THIS MIC OR YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!!\n",
            "187 Are use this to hang my electric guitar on the wall and it was super easy install it looks great and Im super happy with the purchase.\n",
            "188 I'm actually impressed by this mic.  For the price, assuming yours works out of the box, you can't really go wrong.  I bought two for podcasting and plug them directly into my mixer and the sound quality is excellent.  They seem well made (time will tell) and, again, the price was excellent.  Heck, they even look good.  :)\n",
            "189 Love it. Great product. Does exactly what I want it to do. Hold up my guitar!!  Sturdy construction. No complaints. I love it!\n",
            "190 The way these are shipped all scrunched up may make you nervous, but don't worry. They'll be fine.\n",
            "191 You shouldn't have to buy RPS to get strings you can bend.... I have been using Ernie Ball Super Slinkies since the 1980s. I love the feel and sound they produce. but I'm done. I have seen too many .09, .10 .11 and .13 strings slip and let go lately. Could it be that it is impossible or too expensive to make them with quality US-made steel?\n",
            "192 Dont waste your money. Worst clip on tuner I have ever owned. I purchased this to use on a 2nd acoustic guitar. It is very difficult to get the guitar in tune with this tuner. It hunts all over the place looking for the proper note.\n",
            "193 Great Stand!  I use for my Native Instruments Maschine Studio hardware. I hope it lasts long.\n",
            "194 When we lent (and never got back) the clips that came with our&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Behringer-C-2/dp/B000CZ0RLU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Behringer C-2</a>&nbsp;mics, a pair of these clips were the perfect replacements.  The jaws are lined with a grippy foam that hugs the lipstick-sized C-2s but also caresses the tapering ice cream cone body of, say, a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Shure-SM58/dp/B000CZ0R42/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Shure SM58</a>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Samson-R21/dp/B000IJ9GU8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Samson R21</a>.  They're compact enough to fit the case that comes with the Behringer mics and priced for the musician on a budget.\n",
            "195 This dampener works OK, but man it is really clumsy and obtrusive. When it's in the up position you can poke someone's eye out. You're better off learning to use the palm of your hand at the bridge of your guitar to dampen or muffle the sound or try tying a \"hanky\" (handkerchief) at the top of the neck.\n",
            "196 I'm more happy with this purchase than anything I've bought recently.  It's just great.  It's simple, sturdy, well-built, and it holds my dreadnought guitar perfectly.  No room for improvement that I can find in this product.\n",
            "197 These are excellent clamps! I have no idea where the poor ratings below are coming from, for 35mm diameter truss tubing like the TRUSST systems (or any 35mm or 1-3/8\" OD tubing ) these clamps fit like a glove, clamp tightly, have beautiful surface finish that won't scratch, flawless bolt and wingnut hardware, and work perfectly. Will also clamp securely to 1-1/4\" OD tubing. The roll pins that secure the two halves and the toggle bolt are all firmly and properly fitted as well. I got 5 to try since they were such a great price and after receiving them went back for 10 more. These will not work on 1-1/2\" or 1\" or even 1-1/8\" tubing, get the other models for that, measure your tubing! These are also great for putting a light on top of a speaker tripod stand, most of which have a 1-3/8\" tube on top, add the clamp and bolt on your light.\n",
            "198 This was an easy installation. Used it on a recent tele build. Fits right in with hand pressure. Used some light taps with a rubber mallet to seat a few that weren't exactly flush.\n",
            "199 Excellent  fader for my Pioneer DJM-850 Mixer. Make sure sure you go to the Innofader website to and check their listing for the specific replacement for your mixer. Easy Install.\n",
            "200 I so love the simplicity and ease of usage of this AxeRig Tuner!\n",
            "201 This is my 2nd Donner DP-1. The first was purchased to replace a noisy daisy-chain supply. Ran 8 effects, including the Line 6 DL4 (with the reverse polarity adapter) without any noise, power interruptions, or channel failures. From what I understand (after a lot of reading/research), these seem to be independent channels, but share a common ground. I'm not an electrician, but I do know that whether I'm running through my amp at home, or through the PA at church, I'm getting zero noise. Quite content with these.\n",
            "202 These knobs are exactly what I needed for the finishing touch on my Fender Jaguar Bass.\n",
            "203 I never knew this thing existed. I'm so glad I found this as I was always using a regular capo and placing it on just the 5 strings but the grip and placement was awkward and didn't provide a confident grip. Using this allows good grip. I use this a lot to practice my finger-picking songs...gotta love that low E, open string, bass note. Thank you Planet Waves for making this and in a simplistic yet convenient form.\n",
            "204 These are amazing! Not just for the price, they are just really great pickups. I rapped mine with friction tape over copper foil tape to fight against cheap wiring in my home.\n",
            "205 Works great. Improves audio greatly on the BMPCC. So versatile. I can rig it to a camera plug in an external Mic or use it all by itself as a recorder. Not to fond of the thin plastic makes it feel like a cheap toy but it's lightweight and works great.\n",
            "206 I bought a used MIM strat that came with a black pick guard and creamish colored pickups. The guitar was great but the pick guard wasn't my style. I put this on and now I love the look of this guitar. Highly recommend.\n",
            "207 They're pretty decent panels for what it's worth. By far they're not professional grade, but I think they can do well for a small home studio. They are fairly thin, so initially it's going to absorb higher frequencies better than lower frequencies, so keep that in mind.\n",
            "208 Well...it plays perfectly, but the once clear, white on blue lettering rubs right off. Body's natural oils... rub whatever paint they use. I'm considering buying a perm marker in a bright color and drawing them on again. Yes, the gold side is embossed, so it won't rub off, but it's the blue on white that a person looks to for quickly identifying notes. Long-term, it's more about the pitches being stable/etc., but I'm disappointed that only after three uses, the lettering is rubbing off. Put a better finish on these things...coat it with something non-toxic, but non-reactive with oils/acids from people's fingers since that's what we'll be using when we hold the things. Other than storage at home, the soft pouch is useless.\n",
            "209 The metal G is wound and wrapped in plastic to keep it separate.  Great sound, but admittedly I haven't tried any other brand.\n",
            "210 The picture doesn't do this bridge justice, I was skeptical of the quality when I ordered this Tremolo bridge but was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. I wasn't so concerned with the quality because I planed on using it on an old broken down imported Kramer ST300 that I refinished. I gave it a 3 because of the screws it takes a lot of hand strength to get the screws seated. You have to be very careful that you don't strip the philip screw heads the screw driver doesn't quit fit the number 2. I'll take the guitar to my shared work shop to see if a larger screw driver fits better.\n",
            "211 See my review of the Art Pro VLA II which includes  the 355, both Great !\n",
            "212 Check out my photo. After a bit of time, this thing moved and shifted and left sticky un-removable glue all over the head.  Yuk! I did not have this problem with a regular bass drum head.\n",
            "213 This pedal works fine until it breaks, but they WILL break with any kind of moderate use.  The bottom portion is two pieces, and after a little time the plastic which connects the \"pedal\" to the \"frame\" breaks.  It's done it the same way in all of the ones I have.  I've been through about 4 of these in the last 3 years at my church, with two keyboard players using them each week on two separate instruments.  Each of the two keyboards/sustain pedals get used once per week, for about 20 minutes.  I don't think this is enough use to break so consistently.  Our work-around is something firm like a piece of floor tiling on the bottom and a whole lot of duct tape.\n",
            "214 I have been using these straps for at least six years. I have never had them fail once. The tweed material is strong, durable and gets softer the longer you use it. I always attach Dunlop strap locks to my guitars and knowing the metal link in the strap is a great added protection as opposed to the plastic which can break.\n",
            "215 My oldest son plays and owns many guitars. He asked for a new guitar strap for Christmas. I ordered this one because we are Irish and I thought it looked really cool.\n",
            "216 I really love playing this guitar. Every since I received it, it has been by my side. Full sized neck. Sustain is fantastic. It stays in tune even with new strings. Fits perfectly in my suitcase. Will be taking it on all my vacations. I added the foam to the lap rest for a little more comfort while sitting on my lap. Plus, to prevent it from sliding when sitting. If you want a great travel guitar or even a guitar to play around the house, this is the one to get.\n",
            "217 I could not imagine this product was so small but so powerful at the same time. I am using it in my analog mastering room, as a media reader. Especially interesting for the bluetooth connectivity. Connecting the output to one input of a Samson C Control studio controller, and there you go... send the sound wherever you want to direct it in the studio.\n",
            "218 Arrived 3 days after I ordered it, the bent welding should've clued me to what would happen. 2nd time I tuned it the inferior quality tension bolts started stripping, making the macho (small drum) useless. Mostly good materials (oak, steel, rawhide) + terrible craftmanship = drum being returned. Lay down another $30 and get some Aspires, I've gotten 2 sets of those (1 for me, 1 as a gift) and they won't let you down, or you might want to check out similarly priced bongos from Meinl, Gon Bops or Tycoon, but avoid this hunk a junk.\n",
            "219 I bought It to storage my Epiphone Les Paul Standard, It fits perfect, the inside is soft, this case provides a great protection, It's a little heavy, but I think this is the best choice for a epi LP.\n",
            "220 First of all the weight of the keys is absolutely perfect. Second I was hoping that the settings when you play softly or stabbed the keys where almost as accurate as a real grand piano. This is amazing. If you play softly, hitting the keys like a feather, it delivers the signal to the daw flawlessly. I was on a budget when I bought this, I was contemplating waiting for a more expensive one but needed it asap for a project. I'm very happy with this!\n",
            "221 When you buy aftermarket pickup rings, lining up the mounting holes is a concern... however, these lined up perfectly with the holes on my Dean Schenker V.  They are for a flat-top guitar, so if you try to mount them on a Les Paul, which is arched, you'll have problems.  Make sure the pickup rings you order are for the right type of top.\n",
            "222 Good fit on my Epiphone Les Paul.\n",
            "223 You really cant beat it for the price, however, I would not use it for really heavy lights. Its only rated for 50lbs anyway. If you have some LED fixtures, a couple lasers (attached picture).... then this is perfect. Heavy scanners, and other large format lights (even if only using one ~40 lbs) I would not use. It only feels secure enough for a couple smaller lights and a fogger. Just buy it!!! You could always use it in your entertainment center and or, mobile DJ rig for some sort of light application.\n",
            "224 For the money, it is awesome.  I upgraded the transmitter cord, and it cured some of the cable noise. (The one included is a bit long and cheap).  It has a clear sound and good battery life. Plus, the receiver is small enough to fit on my pedal board.\n",
            "225 I love this thing its so convenient to use at my desk! It's sturdy enough for my all metal, b1 conderser mic! I wouldn't use any heavier of a mic though. The shock mount s decent to!! The arm has a decent enough reach for my big desk! Zero complaints.\n",
            "226 Phat,PHILTHY AND JUST PLAIN ON ALL THE TIME!,Grinderthru the THUNDERVERB!\n",
            "227 On the day these picks arrived I went to a gig and put one in my pocket while I set up my gear.  Maybe twenty minutes later, I took the pick out of my pocket and found it had already shed the cork \"grip\".\n",
            "228 My stand came in and it was larger than I expected!! However, I like its features. It can expand to 4 different wide settings. It's perfect and very strong for my bass. Thanks!\n",
            "229 We use these for everything from our acoustic bass down to our ukuleles. I know there is a smaller model available for ukes, violins, etc.; we haven't yet ordered those, but these will work on smaller instruments if one doesn't extend the feet to their maximum width. They're gentle on the instruments, and the grippy material keeps them secure.\n",
            "230 I've been carrying mine around for about ten years, using it as it was designed: easy carry so you can sing \"Kumbaya\" with the gang around the camp fire without disturbing the neighbors.  It has seen a lot of smoke and a lot of salt spray at the beach.  It is NOT a full guitar so don't expect it to act, feel, play, look or sound like one.  It is NOT a beginners' guitar and I would never recommend it as such.\n",
            "231 Was skeptical after reading previous reviews. Very happy with this chair. To be used for saxophone playing. Very easy to assemble as most is already put together. The backing of the backrest and seat isn't the greatest, but will do. The backrest does clank, but a trip to the hardware store and pick up those cork round pads for cabinets, problem solved. This chair is comfortable to me and sturdy enough. I gambled and won with this chair.\n",
            "232 Great quality, good design, look expensive.\n",
            "233 Works fine. There were no instructions. Well actually there were, but they were not in English. It's pretty self explanatory though. Great deal.\n",
            "234 This is a wonderful gig bag! I've included pictures of the more popular styles of guitar so you can see how well they fit. The purple Les Paul style fits snug length wise with the extra cushion pads, and fits snug side to side. The black Stratocaster style is ALMOST to long, but still fits fine. The grey SG style is a small guitar, so there is extra room top to bottom and side to side, but with the neck strap, it doesn't slide around too much, and I would still feel comfortable using this bag with the SG. The padding is aproximently an inch think all around and top and bottom, and the zippers are of good quality.\n",
            "235 I own a Yamaha 61 keys Keyboard and I ordered this stand because the product description says it is Yamaha make. But what is written on the box is:'Keyboard Stand For Portable Keyboards from Yamaha and Others' and there is no Yamaha emblem neither on the box nor on the stand. In fact, it is just a Chinese make generic stand. Apart from that, I am happy with the stand. It is:\n",
            "236 Better thab the terrible string trees my guitar had,  had to drill a small hole though to mount as yoy can see in the pics\n",
            "237 Works Great ...was easy to Install ....Love it\n",
            "238 I bought these for my office. I wanted to put a barrier between the speaker phone and the wall to help reduce echo and keep my nosy neighbor from listening in. I can't tell if you if it works for the neighbor but the echo is gone now. I also have my computer speakers near them as well and that seems to shield a little noise too.\n",
            "239 OK I gave these tuners a 5 and I've not installed them on the Fender Strat they're intended for. Made in the USA machine heads is what I wanted for the MIUSA Strat. I'm doing a custom Strat to raise funds for my web site which is dedicated to Indie Music. I bought this guitar gutted and still need Pick-Ups and hand carved inlay. I will update when I string the guitar and play a few licks.\n",
            "240 I think the amount of positive feedback these mics are receiving should tell you something about how amazing they sound. I just simply want to say that if you purchase these mics, do yourself a huge favor and buy a 6\" gooseneck! I use my Spirits for drum overheads and apart from them sounding incredible, adding a little gooseneck makes this a perfect microphone. The internal shock absorption is actually really impressive! Amazing mics for the money! Grab you a couple!\n",
            "241 It's a tuner and a good one for the price...makes me happy. Love behringer\n",
            "242 Sadly, these strings were suggested as replacements for a Yamaha Guitalele GL-1.\n",
            "243 I really really loved these till this happened at a gig last night ( see picture)\n",
            "244 I put a 10 splash cymbal on this cymbal arm. Works great! I would suggest putting a small piece of rubber under the metal clamp. The one that comes attached is thin and doesnt protect from metal to metal contact.\n",
            "245 All I can say is wow! This has to be the best amp at this price. I chose this over the fender and I'm glad I did. It is clean-sounding smooth has a great tone nice design easily move it around even though it does weigh over 30 lb. This is a bargain I'm glad I went with this brand. The size is big enough to punch out for mid sized church functions with ease! The pic doesn't really show u the size. It's bigger than the pic puts out. No distortion just a clean bass sound... Again A bargain and I will buy a bigger one in the future!\n",
            "246 This is a good buy\n",
            "247 Highly recommend. It did wonders for my Kremona Solea. It's like a totally different guitar. Much more lively.\n",
            "248 I put a set of these on a Jag I finished up a few weeks ago and I'm thoroughly impressed.\n",
            "249 bought this to slap on a cheap p bass from e-bay. I figured if it sucks, its only a few bucks.\n",
            "250 I'm using these high hats for a small kit ,( Pearl Rhythm traveler drum set. ) and they give a good sizzle. For the price that you're paying these little guys give you a great sound. I wouldn't get these if you're planing on playing \"pro live shows\", or recording. I have a pair of zildjian titanium cymbals / high hats and you can tell the difference. These high hats don't hold / sustain their sound for too long. If you're playing rock beat or just starting off.. These are a great starter set, and for the price you can't really disagree. A must have for a start to advanced player.\n",
            "251 Just out these beauty's on my Mitchell and they are perfect. I wanted to add character to my guitar and this definitely helps.\n",
            "252 I'm pretty happy with this string action gauge. It's a sturdy piece of stainless steel with easy to read numbers and measurements etched into the steel. Definitely worth the money paid. A must have for anyone who sets up their own guitars.\n",
            "253 Great kit after leveling and crowning the frets this guitar plays great I love this kit\n",
            "254 Great look. Great product. Great buy!!!!\n",
            "255 Great picks, the best holding pick ever, more of a medium flex.\n",
            "256 These fit my Samson meteor Mic nicely. Also fits great on Zoom H2n. Snug. Good standard foam not thin like some others. Also trimmed one to put over my MSH6 Mic capsule.\n",
            "257 I settled on the Kelly Shu only after reading lots of reviews (of the Shu, May, and Gibraltar offerings). I chose the Shu because it seemed to be the most robust to physical abuse and offers varied placement options. I installed on my 16 x 16 inch Pearl Session floor tom conversion and attached an Audix D6--a rather substantial kick drum mic that is hangs pretty heavy toward the front. I got a little creative with the install, attaching all eight leather straps around the circumference of the drum and weaving the rubber cord (full length) back and forth around the Shu (see photos). I used the May no-drill vent hole mic cable adapter to wire it up. I'm very pleased with the design and quality of the Kelly Shu. Figuring out how to install it was a fun challenge--there were several options and I settled on the one that didn't require me to cut the rubber cord, just in case I change my mind.\n",
            "258 I bought this last week from another retailer. This is the best case I have ever purchased, but it's heavy as hell! I wasn't expecting it to be 150lbs empty.\n",
            "259 I've bought 2 of these as well as an instrument from this seller. The straps are very attractive and sturdy.\n",
            "260 Works great! I was happy with the length of the cables and how sturdy the jacks are. This is a great value, with good quality.\n",
            "261 Provided that this is not a Fender Telecaster but a Squier, I was pleasantly surprised by its playability and its tone. The three pick-up options make it very versatile for any type of music you may want to use it for. The difference in quality between this guitar model and the Squier by Fender Bullet Strat is incredible and well worth the $50 price increase.\n",
            "262 It fits my les paul copy that isn't exactly yhe same size as the lp but i wanted to see if it fits and it does. My epiphone is in the shop so i might as well use it for my other guitar.\n",
            "263 The naugahyde cover was lifting and the glue residue was tacky. The fit for my Tele was not as right. For my Schecter it was good.\n",
            "264 I love this strap! It's beautiful and comfy and fits great. Yes drilling into my uke was scary but there are really good videos out there that make it easy. The shoe string got in my way so I strapped it to the g string tuner. I dunno how smart that is but it's my life I can do what I want!\n",
            "265 tried something different rather than my daddario xl 10's ( nickels)...- they didn't seem as  as smooth  and  initially i thought they had too much bite  - overly bright not as balanced as the d'ad's 10 pure Nickel... BUT  after 2 days they have settled in and like all strings have  gotten some wear and sound much better!  very clear  and punchy - a tad bright for my style but  still good  im sure its perfect for many!- if they hold up for a decent spell ill adjust my review to 4 stars...they have -I did\n",
            "266 This thing works!  I use a DW 3000 Double-Pedal, and have had issues with the slave pedal sliding forward - even though it comes with it's own built-in spurs.  The DW's onboard spurs are about where the ball of the foot goes, so with the pedal jumping, even when extended all the way down, the pedal still moved (hopped?) forward.  I tried adding additional Velcro, but that didn't stop it.  But now, with the Pearl Pedal Stabilizer on the front of it, it stays put.  The Pearl's long spikes go deep into my old oriental carpet that I use as my drum rug at a perfect angle to restrict any forward movement.  Now I can really kick it hard!  Pleasantly surprised at how heavy-duty and large it is.  If your slave pedal has a hoop clamp on it, you're ready to go right out of the package.  The spikes also can be reversed with rubber tips for hard surfaces.  I don't really need that feature as my rug goes with me to gigs.\n",
            "267 Time will tell how it holds up...\n",
            "268 Poorly manufactured.  The plastic cushion top was only halfway attached.  See photo.\n",
            "269 It's definitely tiny. They weren't kidding about that. That being said, the screen is 1\"X1\", but pretty bright and easy to read. The colors are rich, which helps. I play 6, 7, and 8 string guitars and was able to tune all 3 with no problems. Quick detection, and accurate. Even the F# on the 8 string was picked up almost instantly.\n",
            "270 Awesome stand!\n",
            "271 This plate comes with a cheap, worthless jack installed in it. I was planning on throwing it away and installing a Switchcraft 11 jack in it instead. The mounting hole diameter was 9.5 mm, and the Switchcraft uses a 3/8\" mounting hole, so I needed to use a 3/8\" drill bit to widen the hole just slightly. 9.5 mm is .374 inches, so it is only one thousandth of an inch different, but did need to be expanded nevertheless. It also only came with 2 screws instead of the 4 needed. I had the four screws that came with the guitar anyway, from the plastic jack plate I was replacing, so that was no problem either. The screws were a bit bigger than the intended screws so it gave it a bit more of an industrial look that was unintentional but I think it looks good nonetheless. It was a little bigger than the old jack plate as well so I had to bondo in the screw holes and drill others out, but that's pretty much par for the course with aftermarket modifications of any sort.\n",
            "272 Simple, cost effective, no frills design that gets the job done. Hardly worth noting, but there are no mounting instructions. It should be intuitive, however.\n",
            "273 These are very sturdy and useful. I have one for gigs, one for busking, and a backup. I prefer hanging my violin on a stand than laying it in my case. It feels more secure and I have quick access.\n",
            "274 Worked great... for about 9 months. Then poof. Its dead. Fuse is fine (double checked with meter), was plugged into a power conditioner/surge protector. It just stopped working. No power at all. Learned my lesson, Behringer products just don't last.\n",
            "275 I love these great finish and quality\n",
            "276 This amp is the real deal.  Great crunch and gain tones and with some tweaking, not half bad clean\"ish\" tones.  I've played this through the two 8\" Orange cabs (had to get those too as they were just TOO cool ((and cute)) and not crazy money) and the sound is very pleasing and revealing for a practice amp.  I primarily play it through my Blackstar stack that I've fitted with Celestion V30s... Wow...there it is~!!!  You would never know this thing was such a tone monster... Even with just a few knobs it's easy to get lost for hours playing this thing.  My favorite match is with my Chapman ML-1 Hotrod...which only has a volume \"tone\" control (EVH fans get this).  Not a lot of mucking around with too many knobs or too many options on either the guitar or this amp... Just tone up and go.  I see the Micro Dark just came out...that's probably next~!  Higher gain, buffered effects loop and speaker emu at the headphone out for recording direct (if that's your thing).\n",
            "277 I purchased an old Yamaha E112C electric guitar that needed to be completely redone and I decided that I would replace the original chrome parts with Gold and the strap pegs look great. You can't see the strap pegs in the picture you do see the color and how the gold parts look.\n",
            "278 Fit my Epiphone Les Paul 100 perfectly.  Swapped out factory cream colored trim for these and they look great. Posting before and after pics\n",
            "279 I love this thing, I've used it for so many events now.\n",
            "280 Brass Tacks: is this the greatest mic in the world? No. But on a budget this mic is AMAZING. The lows and highs sound great and the mids sound well fleshed out. If you are looking for s nice rich sound, this is it.\n",
            "281 I installed these Grovers to my LTD and it went smooth as can be! Absolutly no problems. The strings I installed were new and held their tune far better than than new strings without the locking feature. I was a bit nervous because these do not have a button type to secure the strings. Grover has another mechanisim to lock the strings in place. It works great! Just make sure you hear the click! Its not loud so you may want to install these in a quiet place. Read the directions carefully and your all set. I put a set of the same Grovers on my cheapy Johnson hollowbody. Perfect fit!\n",
            "282 they sound good i found that the wiring is off but can be sequenced properly using this diagram colors are different but sequence is the same top left is hot, bottom left goes with ground/bare, two on right are together or can be used for tap\n",
            "283 I chose this cable b/c it was supposed to have the more durable metallic interfaces and superior strain relief as pictured. What showed up is nothing more than some cheap and flimsy cable that can be bought for a lot less elsewhere. I feel cheated.\n",
            "284 Freakin' sweet y'all!\n",
            "285 I had fun putting the kit together. I made a simple customization by adding two WWII  vintage decals (from etsy). Like most other builders, I swapped strings. I also re-arranged a few steps in the instructions. I will try to add photos showing the decals. (At the moment I do not see how to add photos).\n",
            "286 I  hooked up the light to a karaoke and mixer board very happy and pleased with her performance .  Lights are controlled by a DMX  DJ  Operating board .\n",
            "287 Go up 1 size. My hands are not large for my size and they are certainly not thick. I wear a size medium glove comfortably and large is almost always too big. Yet a size medium in these barely squeezes onto my pinky. Sizing is not close to accurate. Even used a heat gun to expand the opening slightly, no go. Just makes them wider bUT thinner. Disappointed\n",
            "288 This stand is great. Its light weight and sturdy base when extended to 9ft. It has screws for 8 lights so you can fit any size light on the T-bar. I have an Eliminator Lighting Katana LED, on one side and it takes up about 3 of the screw locations. You can fit a single projector light on this stand if you remove the T-Bar. Pictures show a close up of the screw that hold the t-bar/projector light.\n",
            "289 I used this on a custom bass build and it worked great!\n",
            "290 This stand is very portable and compact, but I no longer have confidence in it's ability to keep my electric basses safe. My vintage Fender Jazz Bass would not fit correctly due to the offset body shape and a few years ago it fell over causing significant damage to the headstock (see picture). After this, I resigned to use this stand only with my Fender Precision Bass which has a more symmetrical body shape, but even this bass has come close to falling over if not placed just so. I've decided to go back to the more traditional type of guitar stand for my instruments.\n",
            "291 A great product, which made a wonderful under-bed light in our application.\n",
            "292 I upgraded the bass and tom tom heads on my Pearl Rhythm Traveler kit (ASIN: B0002FO4R8) to these heads with amazing results. Before upgrading the open bottom toms had a lot of ring and were impossible to get the tone I wanted no matter how carefully I tuned them. I replaced the heads with these and was rewarded with an amazing difference in sound quality. The ringing, hollow quality I previously struggled to correct is now a nice \"thump\" sound that works perfectly with jazz and rock.\n",
            "293 great little stand , good price and fast prime shipping make this a good deal and value...i got it paired along with a ChromaCast small bench stool also folding...only down side was that the stand was missing one of the rubber end caps for the top crosspiece, so my keyboard is a little tippy and unstable....i'm trying to figure out how to get only the missing end cap piece and not have to return the whole stand,and wait for a replacement.\n",
            "294 Not real happy with this but then I wanted to save some money.  Not a very good decision on my part.  Should have shelled out the $30-35 for an actual Fender or Fender licensed pickguard so I'll eat this.  But I'm posting so YOU don't have to make my mistake.  Not knocking the company either, they tried but just didn't get it right.  See the pics.\n",
            "295 Needed something cheap but that worked for the bedroom. My main gear is upstairs in my studio but I often practice in my bedroom. I run a little Fender Champ combo in there and wanted some dirty tones for classic rock, blues and some heavier rock. This did the trick. Made of plastic but seems durable enough for my needs. Get some really cool tones out of this pedal. Can dial in almost any blues or rock tone I want. Was impressed by it for such a low cost pedal. For the money it was a very good choice.\n",
            "296 GREAT FIXTURE\n",
            "297 I loved this guitar stand at first b/c it held my Guild & Martin acoustics securely. After about a year of stationary use, the plastic housing which was responsible for holding up the neck support cracked and cannot be repaired (see pics). Since I'm past any warranty period, I'm stuck.\n",
            "298 This guitar is an amazing value!!! USA pups, chunky neck, and a fast fretboard (very round radius!) Its the kind of guitar you never want to put down. Switching options make it very versatile. My only criticism is the poly blonde finish is very plastic looking. Thankfully the grain is showing through more and more every day. I leave mine in the sun and may repaint in the future.\n",
            "299 Poor design doesn't line their own pedals up when connected using these. The offset isn't enough and results in each pedal along the line mounted a bit lower than the one next to it. As you can see in the picture, the third pedal from the chain is already almost off the board. How can they overlook this?\n",

            "303 Excellent, clear, punchy, great note definition. 60s rock, 70s R&B, modern jazz, this set covers it all. I build custom guitars and basses, have tried many different types and brands. These are my go to pickups. To be honest, I was a bit surprised at how articulate these are, as the SD quarter pound p-bass pickups are somewhat dark.\n",
            "304 I'd been searching for a while, to find a reverb pedal that would be able to fill the shoes of the built-ins that I'd used in the 60's and 70's... and here it is. Due to the unheard of low price, I half expected to get a \"half fast\" performance from this pedal, but fortunately, this was not the case. Upon plugging in the unit, and testing it with my Les Paul guitar, and my practice amp, I was amazed to hear how well this inexpensive pedal was able to replicate those old-school tones. This included emulation of multiple reverb types, such as  \"spring\", \"plate\", \"hall\", \"gate\", \"room\", and a really cool new one called \"modulate\" that throws a hint of chorus into it. Behringer not only got my money, but my respect and gratitude.\n",
            "305 This tailpiece is very solid and the plating and finish couldn't be better. So great for the price. I don't expect plating will stand contact/rubbing for long, but that's the case with most gold plated hardware, so I suggest any gold hardware be handled delicately. I know gold plating costs so much more than its price, so it's a bargain.\n",
            "306 Lets just start off by examining the price. At under twenty dollars you won't find many competitors, especially with this build quality. It is essentially an embroidery hoop with black pantyhose, an adjustable arm and screw clamp. Building one yourself will probably run you over twenty dollars and you will end up with an interesting mixture of distracting textures and colors, so why not just buy it instead? Functionally it works fine. It does muffle sound to some extent when stacked up against a metal mesh screen but for anything short of an audience of 50,000, it should appease just fine. all in all, if you are hitting annoying pops in your recording and don't want to spend a lot of money -- this is the way to go.\n",
            "307 For practical purposes, these patches are thin (which I like) and clear (if you get the clear ones).  They are not hard \"plasticky\" (yes, I made up a new word...remember you heard it here first) but have a snug, comfortable feel under the teeth. I use them on my OBrien crystal and Richard Hawkins Model G mouthpieces and they look great.  Now, the best thing about them for me personally is the R....my name is Robert.  Hah.  Looks like I have custom mouthpiece patches. ;-)\n",
            "308 I am 61 years old,been playing since 14. I have bought 4 or 5 Crescents over the years and have not found a lemon yet. These are great guitars!!!!!! I left the strings that came with it on,and after they quit stretching(like any set of strings will do)it stays perfectly tuned. I will be buying more to start a good collection and would highly recommend this to a friend. It is a keeper for sure!!\n",
            "309 In theory this is a great pedal but they are notorious for having problems freezing up. Mine is basically a paper weight right now. It has to go to a service center to be reset. From everything I've read on forums, odds are that it will probably freeze up again after being repaired. Hopefully not but I'm not feeling very optimistic. When / if TC gets the software to be more stable then this would be a fantastic product but until that happens I can't recommend it.\n",

I purchased industrial strength velcro to mount my pedals, and i mounted my Donner power supply to the bottom of the board using velcro with no issues.

Having bought then outside of the US it was very difficult to get the warranty honored so I decided to fix them myself as I am a technician. What I discovered was the volume controller which is also the Power switch was defective, and I could not get a replacement. so what I did was replace the volume control with another one and and added a power switch. Now it works like a charm.\n",

            "317 It works, for the price, for what it is. I needed a gig bag, at about 25 dollars in a hurry, for carrying my carry around bass around town- in/ out car, hanging out at coffee shops, walking around place to place. If I had about 50 dollars I would have bought the next model up, the G4 or whatever, with more padding, but I didn't, and this one is doing the job just fine. I have a Precision Bass copy (an Epiphone Accu-Bass, hence the weird headstock) , and it fits in the bag.  The bag is protective enough and seems durable enough for the purpose of carrying the bass around town. The pocket won't hold much- just strings and some music, but the bag does carry the bass.\n",

I don't know why they're described as \"Acoustic\" holders, I'm them using them to hold a heavy Fender Precision bass, and other standard electric guitars. They're easy to install, but as others have written, do not use the fasteners that come in the kit. They are cheaply made and are unsafe. I simply stopped by Walmart and picked up a couple packs of self-drilling drywall anchors (pictured). They're inexpensive fasteners and helped make the installation a breeze. I was able to install all six guitar stands in about 30 minutes.\n",

It's good for 6 string guitars but 7-8 strings may have more problems. The design is nice and the color is beautiful. It feels quite fragile since it's plastic so you have to be careful with it but it's cheap enough to replace without worry. Nice to have if you don't have a line in through tuner like the Korg pitch black.\n",
            "327 Hot damn!  I replaced the original neck position humbucker on my 1980 Les Paul (which I bought new) with a SPH90 Phat Cat.  What a difference!!  It is MUCH louder, and brighter, and all around sweeter and more tuneful that the original.  I used to rarely use the neck pickup alone.  Now I'll use it almost exclusively (though mixing in a bit of the bridge humbucker is sweet too).  I'm very glad I bought this and made the switch.  P.S. - I've had no problem with hum from this pickup - if you do, your problem is probably somewhere in your amp.\n",

All of this, without losing the guitar's natural voice. Installed it in a '78 Stratocaster, and gave it a new life. It's just too bad that it took me decades to finally take the plunge to switch from a Super D. (which had been my go to in all my guitars since the mid 80s).\n",

It also works with no power at all (but the lights come in handy to know which selection is ON).\n",

Definitely will do what you want and last a good long while.\n",

I highly suggest this kick-pad if you're looking for one that will last long and protect your bass drum from injury  =D\n",

It is definitely a cheap buy, and still looks like an amazing cymbal. As for sound, it does sound pretty crappy. But it's still a great buy for beginner drummers, or drummer who just like to jam out in their basements/garage. Once you start to get a gig or two, you should consider going with a better cymbal\n",
            "340 I've been using these windscreens for years on all kinds of mics, and so has the entertainment industry. They block out wind noise and plosives without affecting the sound of the mic, not to mention the square shape is more visually-appealing to use on a mic like a Beta 87C than a ball-shaped windscreen. Speaking of ball-shaped mics, you can even get these to work on those. The proof is as easy to find as turning on your TV in the morning--under the A85WS on Wayne Brady and Jonathan Mangum's mics on \"Let's Make A Deal\" is a Beta 58A cartridge.\n",

This left me with roughly 1/3\" of the string that does not match (Pic). I'm honestly not sure if this is an isolated incident or if all packs will yield the same result. I will give them another try in hopes of a better set, but if this is the standard then D'Addario should really consider the extended scale of 8-string guitars and ensure the strings are wound far enough.\n",

The hangers are rubber coated to prevent finish damage.  The instructions are simple and I had this installed in under 5 minutes.  There are no screws visible once the unit is on the wall.  I was initially worried that the guitar would hang too close to the wall, however it is a good 3.5\" away.  It did take some \"oomph\" to get the actual hanger prongs parallel to the floor, but it certainly feels solidly locked in.  I was fortunate enough to have a location where a stud was available (and I would highly recommend using a stud for the install), however 2 heavy duty screw-in wall anchors also come with the unit for drywall mounting.  I much prefer this clean look to having the guitar on a floor stand in the corner where it tends to gather dust and dog hair. Ugh.\n",

I ordered one that had been returned so it was sold as used, it was sent through the APO mail system (which I really appreciate with Amazon), but could not find a mark or smudge on it.  It was as new as it could be. Much to my surprise, it was also \"IN TUNE\". It was setup perfectly.

With no change other than plugging in the Shure Super 55, adjust input trim on mixer and some minor EQ, the difference in her voice was remarkable. Very even and consistent response across vocal frequency range. Some presence enhancement,  subtle and helps vocals punch through mix. Another reviewer mentioned the Shure Super 55 may have some compression characteristics -- I agree and it's a good thing; she is able to get right up to the mic, soft or screaming, it doesn't peg the meter (much) on my board. Another thing is that she *loves* the look of the Super 55 Deluxe; puts her in the mood for that 40's/50's jazz stuff she does so well :) Overall - we are very happy with the Super 55 Deluxe and I will probably get a second one for myself soon.\n",

Although they are thin, I still feel an slight edge when I run my fingers across them. We'll see,... kinda skeptical on how long these will last.\n",
            "391 These are great lights for the cost.  Currently have 17 in use for our theater. We built pyramids for a theater production. We have 5 lights filling the pyramid shape.  Been a great effect with huge applause for just the lighting.\n",
            "392 I have 3 daughters and last year I bought my oldest a guitar.  She's been kind of luke warm ever since getting one but my middle daughter has been asking for one for a while now, so this was her birthday gift.  It's what you'd expect it to be....it's a Fender, but it's a Squier...so it's going to be mass produced \"alright\" quality for the most part, but not stellar by any means.  Nevertheless, it gets the job done (getting someone young interested in the learning process).  Be prepared to tighten down the various screws and nuts on the guitar when it arrives (this is why I docked them one star).  Personally I dislike strats, but this seemed like the best option to get my kids started on guitar.\n",

            "396 This is a decent case for 100 bucks. I've owned mine approx 1.5 yrs but have not used for gigging until recently. There are 3 hinges that work fairly well. Surprisingly the carring handle has broken off and the humidifier is a B!*Ch to remove so I use a sound hole humidifier.\n",

            "398 I bought the classical guitar case. It fits my Ruben Flores 1200 perfectly. I had my doubts for the low price. It's very solid constructed. It comes with two keys for a lockable latch. It has a nice surface texture that feels like leather. The whole thing feels really well-built.\n",
            "399 NOT as advertised.  They claim these are Rapco Horizon Cables, but they are actually Stagemaster - whoever that is.  Rapco Horizon cables offer a lifetime warranty and they LAST!!!

This is a very quality product.  Especially for the price.  My guitar body didn't have pickguard holes, so I had to drill them.  I just taped this pickguard down in place and drilled the holes.

            "403 Perfect gauge for me. Easy to strum or pick with. Does not slip off my fingers easily. Previously I bought Fender's Medium picks, however they are too thin despite also labeled as Medium. I have also tried many other brands, but most of them are too slippery for me to grip on. These picks work best for me. Perhaps you should not choose color White like I do. It looks too plain and rather yellowish.\n",
            "404 Kit is awesome. I play in my garage just for personal enjoyment not for performances or anything. Once you take the time to break down all the settings, your able to dial in pretty much any kit and sound.

            "407 Never lose your pick again. This is an essential item in your repertoire of gadgets for guitar players. I tried this almost on every surface I could possibly stick it to, and every time it worked great (except on dry wall...). Needless to say, this is designed for guitars, so any guitar you have, you can stick it to. No adhesive, no tape, no mess. Just press, and there you have it. Check the pics. I love Ernie Ball products, and this is another winner. Patent pending, made in China.\n",

Note that the adjustment is by rotation of the arms to adapt to the neck size of your guitar.  The arms are padded to protect the finish on your guitar.\n",
            "413 First of all i would say that for the price, this is something you don't want to let pass. Dont be fooled for the size, these lights are just more than bright. I had some problems with one light out of 4, but customer service was able to help me asap. DMX controls, they work amazing. I would highly recommend these lights to anybody.  In the picture i added i have just one of them lights in purple, wich i used on for the floor.\n",
            "414 Has a great sound to it, a really wonderful tone. I would highly recommend it over any other phaser in the same price range and maybe double its price range, nothing can touch it in terms of its sonic quality, and it's a great bargain for the money. No hum and coloring of tone. Built like a tank and has a small foot print on your board. Sounds very close to the MXR Phase 90, just a bit more suttle and a lot smaller. I was a little worried after I ordered the pedal. Being used to a Mutron Bi-Phase, I didn't know how the Donner would perform. BOY, was I surprised. Not only could I get that Van Halen phase sound, I also got a great classic Alabama, Waylon sound too. It is built rugged and simple. Who could ask for more.\n",

It's very well-made with really good quality zippers and construction, with roomy front and side pouches I haven't even used yet. :) The bag comes with 10 dividers (I only used 8...description says it comes with 8, but I'm pretty sure I got 10) which can be repositioned with velcro (probably much neater than I've done here).\n",

            "421 Here's the thing about XLR cables. If they work, they work and you never notice them. If they don't work, they create more of an issue than you can dream. I purchased 2 CBI cables and received them within the appropriate time line and they were well packed. However, as you will see in the photos below, one of the cables was absolutely a terrible cable to send out. The connectors were covered in some sort of sticky mess and the Phillips screw was completely stripped out on of the connectors. Terrible terrible experience for me. I will attempt to return this cable and receive another from the company.\n",

I have two beautiful Dixon Hummingbirds, and these are the only straps that are just as beautiful as my guitars. I loved the first one I bought so much that I bought two more. I put one on on my pretty Schecter SIII Custom electric guitar as well. They are really well made. I have not seen better quality on another strap I've owned.\n",

Back then everything was Solid State and Analogue. With this Scarlett Solo, a moderate computer, and a large monitor (i stress large because there is too much control with the software), you can really lay down some serious tracks.\n",
            "428 I own 4 Gibsons and 3 Fenders. And this guitar. I've played this against MIM Fender Teles and IMO, this guitar sounds better, even with just the stock pups. No, seriously. My guitar guy says the same thing. I put Ernie Ball 9s on mine and it plays really good. I don't care where it's made nor what it costs, it is a great guitar for the money. Very solid build and save for a few rough fret edges it came in great shape. A tele with some distortion is one of life's great sounds IMO. Recommended. Cheers\n",
            "429 Love this cable! I bought a purple (red & blue knitted) one and a green one. Both look great, sound clean, and work fantastic. I only need to stand a few feet away from my amp, so I'm good with 10 feet. But wanted to point out its not super long. If you like to walk around....get a longer one.\n",
            "430 Overpriced. You should get a coupe dozen for this price. Buy some tubing at a home improvement store, drill holes in it, cut them apart and make your own. The tubing costs less than $.50/foot and you can make 10. I am an orchestra teacher and I've made thousands of these.\n",

            "432 First off this is NOT a leather strap. Only the ends are leather. I've owned this model in 3\" several times. I keep coming back because of the style. But the glue they use to piece the front and back together cannot stand sweat. So it separates pretty quickly, after about 4 uses. The sad thing is the strap is made quite well except for the plastic end that holds the nylon strap part to it. If it breaks, your $2000 plus guitar takes a dive. Using strap locks, I would prefer if they used a metal part instead of the plastic part. But the separation is a real downer. All they would have to do is sew or use better glue. They must know this is a factory defect, but for many years now all my straps have done the same exact separation in the same exact place. Total I have purchased a dozen of these straps for my guitars.\n",

            "436 I saved my money for retirement, so I could afford a quality musical instrument. I did all my online research, and tested many guitars at music shops. Some felt like works of art, flashy, shiny, with that dipped in plastic look and feel. The Jim Dandy looked old style with jumbo fret markers, and a satin type finish...I thought it was old! I strummed a few chords and it played ok. I liked the short size and bought a back pack style case. I ride my bike two miles with my guitar every day to jam with friends at the Marina. This Gretsch Jim Dandy kicks mine and everyone that hears or plays it's butt! It stays in tune and the sound it puts out, tho not too loud, is pure nostalgia at it's finest! She cries the blues, yet if you finger pick a happy tune, you can't stop from smiling. This may not be an expensive instrument, but it's a true classic.\n",
            "437 im not sure why this stand only gets a 3star rating.it took less than 10 minutes to put together and works great.ive attached a pick.id buy another.\n",
            "438 I have owned two Martins over the years. I have been playing only electric guitars the last many years. I came across some old songs I wrote for the acoustic guitar. I tested several guitars because I wanted a nice kick back acoustic that covered all the base and mids I remember from the Martin coffee house days. I did not like the new guitars, they did not sound the way I remember them. I walked out of my favorite music stores with out any guitar. My friend told me to try a Canadian made guitar a Seagull. I never heard of them. I saw a few for sale used, that's good because I wanted an old one. I tested a 1996 S6 Seagull and the sound, power and tone from this guitar was fantastic. I bought it, set the action very low and put some #9 strings one it. This cedar top has a magic to it and I am pleased with this one. Just as fine to play as the crazy priced guitars.\n",
            "439 This is a practical and versatile instrument tuner. It includes a metronome and tone generator and a variety of settings. The clamp attaches easily to an instrument and the tuner can rotate to the angle that is convenient for seeing it. The power and function buttons are easy to use. This does have a few limitations, such as the frequency range limit of 435-445 hz. The meter shows you if you are flat or sharp or right on the note, and this is a precise tuner - you won't get the green light if you are slightly off. I have tried multiple tuners and this one is good, with the extra features that make it a great value and go to accessory for musicians. I received a sample at no cost for my honest, unbiased review.\n",
            "440 Great quality mount and price. The inner clamp is padded which prevents scratches. However, no adapter in package. Though you won't need one for most standard threads. Still, an adapter would have been nice for smaller threads.\n",
            "441 Loving these vintage springs on my vintage strat. They have a good tension and great stability. If you are floating your bridge and want the most out of your springs than these are the way to go.\n",

It sounds great even before processing, and with some compression and EQ, it sounds fantastic. It rejects a ton of background noise and sounds amazing.\n",
            "444 This product so far has been absolutely stunning. I believe that it most definitely CAN be used for professional soundtracks and music. But duh, FL Studio is for the super duper professionals, blah, blah, blah. I use it for my YouTube channel it's been nothing but wonders for me! It's funny because when I first received the item, I SUCKED at doing anything on this software. Then, five days later of experience and watching about two videos on this, I felt like a confident pro! If you're frustrated at first with the software then don't fret. You're not the only one, and you'll get the hang of it.\n",
            "445 OMG! This is perfect ! I was hesitant to go drilling a hole in my Ukelele but wanted to have the option of amplification. This fit the bill with easy quick insallation ! No miss no fuss and it produces great ,clear wonderful sounds . I placed the pads in a triangular formation from the bridge down to the sound hole. I did take a tip from someone and got glued the solder joints on the piezos for added protection. 30 minutes total install time and that's cuz I have big club hands lol  . This is a true bargain quality piece comparable to the KK mini but about 80.00 $ cheaper .  In fact I used the KK installation video online to do the job . Highly recommended !\n",
            "446 Great item, I installed it with no problems, I ordered together with the Shure A26X 3 Inch extension,following the recommendations of one reviewer here on Amazon, I'm glad I did, my Keyboard it's the Yamaha PSR S900, which has built in speakers and makes the keyboard \"thicker/Higher\" than a regular keyboard so the extension it's definitely needed. I also order the OnStage Boom stand arm, everything works great I also ordered[To arrive Thursday] the quick clip extension just to make it easier to remove.\n",
            "447 Buy it! just perfect, small, strong, good sound quality\n",
            "448 Great cable for the money.  The 90 degree connectors are excellent to minimize the strain on acoustic guitar jacks.\n",
            "449 It's really flexible on how you're planning to put on top of it. The only small con is the top surface, you might wanna get a cheap Ikea board for it so you can throw anything. I put my guitar amp head (around 40lbs I think), and two monitor speakers without a problem. Love it!\n",
            "450 Looks great in my white Michael Kelly Patriot, although I'm always a sucker for the 3 ply with white in the middle and it really pops on a white guitar with black trim.\n",
            "451 Line 6 Relay G10 is very awesome. I had been in the market for quite some time when I saw this being advertised. My friends have other systems and they all have a chord leading to a small pack they wear on their hip. I didn't want the added \"baggage' to carry as I also have in ear monitors that have said \"baggage\". This thing performs through my entire house and on stage. It's a wonderful edition to my gear most definitely CHARGE PLUG AND PLAY. You will not regret it!\n",
            "452 Bought this for the brass tip, didn't need the rest. Just wanted to beef up my Zakk Wylde Les Paul Custom Plus to make all the gold hardware match. Does the job perfectly!! But be warned: the added weight of the metal gives the switch a much heavier and thicker clicking sound when switching from pup positions. It doesnt bother me because I play metal and this sound doesnt come through the amp. But for you clean players, this heavy clunk might be audible through your amp. However, I would still give it a shot and see if you like it and can even hear it because it looks great and everyone hears their music differently! And I actually like the added chunky feel. Makes my Grail feel just a bit more tough!\n",
            "453 I purchased these for my oldest son. He plays multiple instruments and had talked about wanting some thumbpicks for his acoustic guitar. I'd much rather purchase items to enhance his musical abilities than video games any day!\n",
            "454 I purchased this from a different store with a gift card. It lasted less than 10 string changes. The design could be easily remedied by using a metal shaft instead of a piece of plastic. After it broke, it took about 10 minutes for me to drill the hole out a little and then put a screw in there. Works fine now. If you are up for purchasing a thing that's going to last a few times and then spend a little time fixing it, then this is your product!\n",
            "455 This was a excellent purchase ! I struggled to find a stand that would allow me to use my bass pedals with my keyboards. I just couldn't find a stand wide enough . This stand was absolutely perfect ! Good heavy duty construction. Quality product !\n",
            "456 Cuts strings perfectly....had no problems even with very light gauged strings...4 instead of 5 stars because it stays open, however, it was easily fixed by simply using a rubber band.\n",
            "457 This is a nice stand, but it doesn't work great for my concert-sized ukulele.  It's definitely durable and adjustable, but it's a little too large for my instrument.  I have tried to pull the legs of the stand closer together in order to better accommodate the size of my ukulele, but in doing that, it feels a bit unstable.  If you're looking for a compact, inexpensive stand, I would definitely recommend this one, but just be aware that it might not work as well for smaller instruments.\n",
            "458 I needed a smaller pedalboard for my solo setup and considered building one. When I saw the price on this one I decided to try it. Awesome. I fit a large amp pedal, EQ pedal, loop pedal, loop controller pedal and surge protector on this bad boy with room to spare. Well made and packs up compactly. Before you break out the plywood and Velcro give this pedalboard a go.\n",
            "459 Having a blast!  Never played before today. Took abou an hour and a half to put together. Had to use a LARGE slotted screw driver to ease the clamps open to accept posts with a bit of a twist of the screw driver; once in, they slid all the way in with a bit of help with a few taps of a rubber mallet.  Now it's all together and very snug. Other than that it was an easy paint-by-number set up. The initial sound is great. I'll have to tweak cymbal #3 - (ride) it seems a bit quiet when I hit it. But hitting the button on the head comes out full and loud. So I'll figure that out eventually. Of course that only happens on some of the different kits to choose from. Anyway, from a tenor saxophonist's first time on a full drum set, this is fantastic!\n",

            "463 I struggled for a while to find a good ergonomic position to hold my guitar. Footrests didn't work well for my practice space and somewhat longer-than-average torso, and I always felt my right leg had to be too far outward. I thought this product was a bit expensive at first for what it is - metal and velcro - but it solved everything for me.\n",

            "465 Question:  Are you better off with a hard case? The problem with ukes is that they can get squished.  Also, it's a soprano ukulele!! How much can a hard case weigh?  If you have a hard case, you can throw it in the trunk of your car, pile things on top of it...\n",
            "466 Pretty difficult for Boss to mess this up. Molded plastic box with plastic hinges and space for three pedals (see photos). In fact, if it didn't have the Boss logo pressed into it, this could just as easily be a case for a cordless drill. So long as you know what you are buying, youll probably be pleased.\n",
            "467 I wanted to add karaoke to my services for my mobile DJ business and was looking for something that didn't cost and arm and a leg. I wanted to find something mobile, easy to set-up & affordable. After reading reviews, it was a no brainer so I made the purchase. The stand is sturdy, light, portable & very easy to set-up. I have my 20\" Sharp Aquos mounted on it (see pictures uploaded), and it took me less than five minutes to set up! The only complaint I have is the screws for the mic holders do not fit. They are a tad too big. Either the screws are too big or the holes were not made large enough. It's no big deal. I highly recommend this product. Buy it!!!\n",
            "468 This is a great case the only reason I didn't give it five stars is cause there is no place for the basic cables for the controller power chord and USB\n",

            "470 I now have eight of these.  I enjoy seeing my instruments, and feel confident they are safely off the floor away from little monsters.  I didn't understand they came in different woods so they don't all match.  No matter, they still work well.  I wasn't real sure about the mounting screws that came with them.  However, they have been up a couple of years and no problem at all.  Note, I am not hanging mandolins which are a bit heavier.  I have tenor and soprano ukuleles.  Second note: the cushioned part that holds the instrument comes in different sizes, the narrow size is the one you need for thru tuners.\n",
            "471 Great little mouthpiece sleeve that fits my Otto Link hard rubber tenor sax mouthpiece near-perfectly!\n",
            "472 Adds a nice touch of originality. I paired these with a Fender tweed strap, but maybe it is a little bit of overkill having the F sign everywhere (\"Ok ok we KNOW it is a Fender, come on!\"). They are kind of massive when installed, doesn't look bad but just bulky. Only problem I had is that I had previously installed a set of Dunlop straplocks, and when substituting them for these, the new Fender screw fell kind of short, and never got tight, they always stayed turning around when screwing them. So I had to use the previous Dunlop screws with the new Fender ones, and it worked like a charm. Not a problem of the product, but if one has used something else before, one might have these kinds of issues later. Not as easy to lock into the guitar as other models, this one requires two fingers to adjust, instead of for instance Dunlops, with just a central button. Just be sure that your guitar is strapped when you let it go!\n",
            "473 At first I hesitated because $30 seemed a lot for a mic stand but I decided to just keep the order. It came in about 4 days immediately and I set it up. Wow the quality is amazing. It extends pretty high and far. I was worried at first it would be too small but it soon proved me wrong. There are no flaws. I will definitely order another one soon for my second mic. This product was great and there's a reason this was rated 5 Stars. Great for home studio budgets. Highly recommend!\n",
            "474 100% satisfied. After scraping off the nasty blobs of gunk, a few small drops of this (and some rubbing) restored an almost unusable 30 year old rosewood fretboard. If only it could add some metal to the worn frets...\n",
            "475 For a cheap, off-brand instrument, it plays excellently and resonates very well. The bass feels very sturdy and looks fantastic in person. It definitely needs better strings, but what new instrument doesn't? I haven't tried amplifying it, and I honestly don't plan to, as I only wanted it for the acoustic properties to practice without having to drape myself in cables. The neck is comfortable, the body is well-assembled, and having two strap buttons opposed to the usual single one on most acoustic basses is a welcome feature. The bridge is also very nice: the last acoustic I had, I kept losing bridge pins, so not having to deal with those was a main drawing point for this bass for me.\n",
            "476 Looks great on my sons fender acustic!  Was easy to put on\n",
            "477 This is a great well made pedal board for my home needs. Really well made and the power cord and carry bag for the price is a bonus, all I needed was some 6\" patch cords and attach the included Velcro and good to go.\n",
            "478 I like it.  It fits my cutaway guitar no problemo.  Not sure why others had trouble with it...\n",
            "479 I love these. They look awesome and the oblong shape really helps keep the strap on. I did have to use my previous screws because the ones they came with were just a bit too small. I don't mind the black screws since my new knobs are black and gold.\n",
            "480 I have nothing bad to say about this stand. It works and it gets the job done. I use it at home,  and I have placed it in a corner of the room with 3 electric guitars, one acoustic, and one bass.\n",
            "481 I have been slowly replacing all of the hardware on my old harmony stratocaster with Fender parts. These had a huge impact as my guitar now stays in tune. Excellent price to quality ratio. Would recommend to a friend.  Looks great as well.\n",
            "482 These cables are perfect for pedalboards that need a little more reach than average. They aren't as cheap looking as other budget cables.\n",
            "483 This foam windscreens are a little bit smaller than I had hoped. They will fit most microphones, but unfortunately my Blue Yeti is too large to comfortably fit these covers on. Even after stretching the foam and muscling it on, the foam still leaves a bit of the microphone's mesh uncovered. I'll attach some photos of how these windscreens fit different types of microphones.\n",
            "484 I've been playing ProMark 747s for decades....  because my wife likes Porcupine Tree and Gavin Harrison (so do I), she surprised me with a pair of these and I was blown away.  Great grip and great feel.  I've never played with grippy anything but I sure do love it.  I did finally break the pair after some time and it's time for a new pair....  I just with I could roll them on a flat surface to be sure they're STRAIGHT and not warped which I've been bitten by before with online stick purchases.  Here they were before breakage.\n",
            "485 Great light, bright for its size\n",
            "486 Top quality multi ply material...I made double pickguards for my Everly Brothers  J 180 ...had just enough material...it came out awesome...looks awesome...you be the judge\n",
            "487 Impressive brightness, 30 beam angle, and fixture is well-built. Saving static colors was tricky at first, but the vendor was more than helpful with tech support. Once your color is set manually, if you press setup again after setting the color you wanted, you will have the same color next time you power it back up. Overall, impressed considering the cost and brightness. Flawless DMX control!\n",
            "488 This microphone bundle was more than worth the price. The sound quality is excellent. The setup is relatively easy. I use it with a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 which already has phantom power built in. Put the gain at about halfway and it was good to go. Very pleased with it and will most likely be buying another one soon to add to my home recording studio.\n",
            "489 I've been playing for 9 years and was worried this won't be on par with the mid-end guitar I've been using. The guitar both looks and feels great. The finish is very well done. It's got a warm and full sound to it that I really enjoyed, that at times I found myself reluctant to stop playing. And I was really pleased with how smooth the fretting was, it felt like it took less effort to move between the frets and press down than on several guitars I've played on previously.\n",
            "490 Pickguard was a perfect fit for my Squier bass partscaster. It fit all pickup and screw holes dead on. Very happy.\n",
            "491 Quality is questionable; had to glue brackets that the bridge screw into which raise and lower the bridge to the guitar body. Brackets were not properly set and had fallen out of the guitar during shipping. Some of the guitar strings were broken; it's fun to glue and restring a brand new guitar. Since the repairs the guitar is playing well and sounds ok; no string buzz or anything no thanks to Schecter or Amazons questionable shipping practices...\n",
            "492 Just installed my new pick guard and trem cover.  Looks great and fits perfectly on my Squier Classic Vibe Strat.  The only problem is that a Classic Vibe Strat comes with an 8-hole pick guard, and this one has 11 holes.  Good thing is that the 8 existing holes lined up with 8 holes in the pick guard, and I had to drill the remaining three holes.  But since the pick guard was installed already I knew exactly where to drill them.\n",
            "493 It's may best solid state amps I ever had. Very versatile just one cons I can tell be aware when or need to use external pedals need optimization for work as you intended. It's very tricky (remember it's a modeler amp take this in consideration). But for a Stan-alone application it's the best. Have anything you'll need. Just connect your guitar and start playing as that easy.\n",
            "494 Amazing Fuzz pedal really good sound specially when you mixed with Baby Cry Wah and Tube Blackstar amp.\n",
            "495 these are 7\" tall at the microphone, doesn't matter how you have the legs 7\" is how tall they are.\n",
            "496 I got this for my son for Christmas and he really loves it.  He also as a condenser mic that needs phantom power in order to work.  With this focusrite scarlett 2i2 Audio Interface that eliminates that requirement as it also doubles as phantom power.  The mic is very clear when using this recording device.  He uses the Magix Music Maker to record his music.  It is excellent and he has not had any issues with it at all.  I asked him if there was anything negative about it and he said all he can think of is how perfect it is.  You can adjuster mic volume, very clear, he has not heard any cut outs.  The only con is if you leave it plugged in to the USB when you are not using it your voice will sound static, but he said its an easy fix you just unplug the USB and plug it back in.  By the way he is using an old dell laptop and it works great.\n",
            "497 I wanted to wait a few days and give this guitar some time before I reviewed it. I currently own 2 other Dean guitars including a 12 string and I wanted to say that I bought this guitar based upon the reviews here on Amazon which I most often do. I have to admit I really like Dean humbuckers. This guitar did not disappoint.  It is beautiful, and that shiny chrome-like green neck with silver fret bars is awesome.  This guitar is VERY playable--fits well in my hands and has nice low action. I really like the sound it puts out and it DOES stay in tune contrary to the negative comments I read to the contrary.  I really like these tuners because they a precise. It sounds awesome through my Zoom G5 effects pedal. I agree with the reviewer who said 'buy it now'.  You won't  be sorry.  This is now my main squeeze especially for anything rock. I recorded 4 Iron Maiden songs with it.  Sweet!!!!!!!!  I love this guitar. I just love it.  I can't say that enough.\n",
            "498 Bought a bunch of this and it looks awesome. Sound dampening abilities are limited given it's only 1\". If you're not on a budget consider something like Auralex foam, but if you are a normal person without tons of money, this is just fine.\n",
            "499 Before I put this on my guitar I took off the stock pickguard and lined it up against this one to check the alignment -- it was a perfect match.  I couldn't be happier with how it looks on my Mexican Telecaster. Great deal for $10.\n",
            "500 This necks r just as good as a 4 hundred dollar fender reeck I have built 30 guitars usingthis  neck. They always r a perfect fit great to play on with great response and they have that classic Look. So for 40 bucks you can purchase a fine product for a forth of the same quality.\n",
            "501 I had tusq pins on my Alvarez that had become damaged over the years. Been looking at these for a while and figured I'd give them a try.\n",
            "502 Works wonderfully with my MXL 990 Ribbon Microphone! Feels sturdy, easy to adjust, and keeps the mic well in place! It may not absorb as much sound as some specialty shockmounts, but it works perfectly for what it is.\n",
            "503 Easy to install.  Heavy duty.  I mounted mine in a custom built angled top rack.\n",
            "504 What a great new preamp from Fishman the Platinum Stage. It so small fits in a guitar case.  It gets rid of the low mud tone. In guitar mode the bass is at 150Hz, theres a low cut switch for 30hz, 80Hz, and 160Hz.  The middle is from 200Hz-3.1kHz Q1.3 and treble is at 6kHz.  I like that this is battery powered so I can use it with the Bose S1 Pro and my guitars with LR Baggs or Fishman pickups.  On the Cordoba F7 Paco w Fishman Ellipse it sounds great.  Thanks Fishman #FishmanElectronics #Fishman\n",
            "505 ergonomics and useful.\n",
            "506 At last, a neck cradle that makes sense and has some actual thought put into its design. There's a real popular neck cradle that looks like a rabbit and has a nice leather covering. It's rather expensive and I see\n",
            "507 The cable came just as advertised, it was thick, well made and appealing to the sight and touch. Customer care was excellent and I haven't even used the cable yet. I'm positive it will Proform as good as the company has with its follow up on purchase. This is what anyone who shops hopes for in a company and it is rare in today's consumer goods climate. That you very much and from that I highly recommend this product to all customers seeking cables for there Pro gear. DJ Sinista 1 -Alwayz Mobile Productions.\n",
            "508 I love programming with this device and software. Being able to make lighting fixtures and controls that work is amazing.\n",
            "509 Great Unit./....good price....and works well\n",
            "510 Haven't had a chance to really use them other than playing with them for a little bit just to check them out. I'm impressed by the colors, and the wide variety of choices. The price is not bad at all!\n",
            "511 UPDATE THE CONTROLLER BROKE AGAIN. MIC KNOB BROKE THEN THE LEVEL KBOB BROKE\n",
            "512 The first unit I got had a problem with noise on the line and a cyclic distortion. It turns out that the LM chip was overheating and defective. I received a replacement unit, and it works well. There is only a very slight amount of added static now, compared to my other preamp.\n",
            "513 Love this product. I just got it today and it sound perfect. I was skeptical that it would work, but its a Vox product so I figured I would be safe. So awesome to be able to practice without disturbing neighbors and family.\n",
            "514 Perfect fit for 2001 Mexican Standard Telecaster.  Two protective layers of plastic coating.  Looks great!\n",
            "515 I rewired my les paul good stuff!\n",
            "516 A slick pick holder with a small footprint. It sticks with suction -- just press down and it adheres. It pops on and off without damaging the guitar finish so it can be switched between guitars and placed wherever most advantageous for the player. It disengages with ease for storage and/or transport. I switched out a thinner pick in place of the one included and the device gripped it tightly. Ingenious gadget and modestly priced.\n",
            "517 These were a perfect fit for my pedal board. No hum, no crackling, good solid connections.\n",
            "518 Worked for about a week the the weight of the guitar pulled the sheetrock anchor out of the wall and left a huge hole now. It needs to come with better anchors.\n",
            "519 I have a Gibson Les Paul Standard from 2013 with burstbucker pros.  Supposedly the burstbucker pro is wound to sound like the original PAF (how they actually sounded), while the Classic 57 is wound to the original design specification of PAFs (how they were supposed to be made). I just picked up a gorgeous Gibson ES-335 from 2001 with the Classic 57, and man, I like this way better than the burstbucker pro!  Both are great pickups, but these have such great bite in the lead and smooth in neck I can stop listening to it.  Every note rings so nicely.  Between the 2 pickups I can find great jazzy/bluesy tones and some to just rock out!  I can't say enough about it, except I'm really neglecting my chores with all the time I'm spending now enjoying these!\n",
            "520 Sounds better thank my 400. AE Ibanez. First two had defects not major. First sounded great . And the one I have now great too. I would buy again! Great guitar for experienced players and beginers alike. Hope this helps.\n",
            "521 Not bad for the price.  Worked great for my BC Rich retro makeover.\n",
            "522 New fave strings for my Fender Jaguar & Jazzmaster! It gives my offsets extra balls. Unlike many flats which tend to sound dull/plucky and higher tension, these would still give you enough brightness and liveliness with a surprisingly balanced sound throughout all strings. It will be tuned fast and stays in tuned for weeks, they only need VERY minor tuning every now and then. Even the wounded G doesn't bother me, it's pretty subtle you almost wouldn't feel it. It's actually CHEAP considering how long these strings would last.\n",
            "523 Unfortunately this switch creates a large pop when switch on or off. For a DJ or game announcer it is entirely unacceptable to have a big pop every time the mic mutes or un-mutes. It would have only added a very small margin to have done this right. The engineer in me wanted to take it apart and add a resister and cap to fix the problem. I chose to return it.\n",
            "524 Does not fit all guitars but it's cheap so no complaints really makes my band setup appear more professional.\n",
            "525 Hello guys, I'm very disappointed with my purchase... I throw up money with poor plastic. I opened the stick and \"easily\" broke very low quality plastic!! U can see attached photo.\n",
            "526 Look good product, design is great but one thing when we record with impact app it the same sound (pluged and unplugged) not different until you connect with guitarcable.\n",
            "527 This board serves the purpose, and if you know what you're doing it is endlessly customizable.  Just got it today, but I have bg plans for making it work for me. As a good platform for pedals, it's pretty solid.\n",
            "528 Easy to use, clear sound, doesn't compromise your pedal board space. Perfect for me!!\n",
            "529 I got this to replace the bridge pickup on my squire strat. I was skeptical that it would really make much difference, but my feedback problem was solved, and the tone is much warmer and cleaner (the old pickup was just awful). I read comments saying that the green wire goes with the red and the white is hot. Mine came with the red wire as hot, and I didn't change that. It works, and it definitely sounds like a beige pickup is supposed to, so it think you should just trust whatever setup the factory gives you. Also, I know other people explained this, but many said they had to enlarge the pickup hole to accommodate the pickup. You DO NOT. It takes a bit of patience but if you are careful, you can slip it in with no modifications.if you are looking to upgrade a cheap guitar, you should be pretty well satisfied with this pickup.\n",
            "530 I put these knobs on my squire strat, my epi sg, and an off brand strat. They all fit easily enough (a bit snug but I prefer that). They are very heavy and solid feeling. Ive had them on the guitar pictured since I got them a few months ago and I haven't had any problems. I did kind of dent the inside of a gold one as I put it on my squire, so you do have to be careful when installing. Also, as people have said, the black knobs have no hole in the chin to tighten or loosen. As far as I can tell, this is about the best value you can get for these style knobs, and I do not think you will be disappointed with them.\n",
            "531 Best tone I've ever played... Personally, this pedal played with my mustang V solid state amp just make it sound unbelievably good... Every not I feel it so delicate, et powerful. This pedal is very subtle in it's effect, but for those with an ear to listen can tell the amazing rich tone this pedal produces. Please connect it on the FX send return channels of your amp, otherwise if placed in front the pre amp of the pedal will create a little noise...\n",
            "532 After a string change the tips next to the end started chipping away.\n",
            "533 I have a 1950s Fender tweed amp, so I wanted to get this strap to match it. It is a perfect match! The leather on the ends is a bit lighter than in the product picture, but it's fine. I love that the stripe is Fender tweed, which any musician should recognize. It's not garish -- it's a subtle statement. The feel of the fabric is nice, and it isn't too stiff like some straps are. All in all, it was a good purchase.\n",
            "534 I have never used AKG microphones before. I decided to take a chance on this from all the great reviews. They were right! I used this to record a Taylor 914CE, the sound was chrisp, great mid and just enough low to not overpower the sound. I totally recommend this for vocals and acoustic guitar recording!\n",
            "535 It's great bass rosin. I have tried Pop's, Nyman, and Kolstein. I like Pop's and Kolstein the best. Pop's (when fresh) is the stickiest. Nyman is hard and powdery. Kolstein is very sticky and there is almost no powder at all. There is something special in their formulation. I believe Kolstein includes wax in their rosin recipe, which keeps dust from forming. The other benefit of Kolstein is that it lasts for a very long time on the shelf. Pop's will dry out in less than 2 years. Some people will only use Pop's for a few months before throwing it away. I go back and forth between Kolstein and Pop's. I still can't decide which is my favorite. But them both and try it out.\n",
            "536 So far so good. Never heard of Lazarro and who cares? The saxophone can perform. The brand doesn't matter. It is just a label. I'm on month 5 and it is holding up. Play it everyday. Upgraded the mouthpiece to a Clark Forbes Debut mouthpiece. The reeds that the sax comes with isn't that great. Mine came with Lazarro reeds 2 1/2 strength and now I use D'Addario Select Jazz reeds 3S and it does the trick.  If you know how to take care of the saxophone it'll last. Well worth the investment. This is the perfect saxophone for those looking for a great instrument without paying hundreds to thousands of dollars.\n",
            "537 I first considered the Cordoba concert ukulele because it was on every list of the best beginner ukes, and I am so happy with my choice! It took about a week to stretch the strings and stay in tune, but the Cordoba sounds amazing. My daughter has a cheaper soprano uke and the Cordoba has a noticeably clearer sound and is much lighter weight. It just feels great in my hands. I tried some no-drill straps, but ultimately chose to add a strap button with no problem. I saw some reviews about quality control issues on the finish, and I did find a rough spot on the back (see photo). This was not an issue for me, but I'd suggest checking for this. Otherwise, I love everything about my Cordoba ukulele and highly recommend it for beginners. From my experience so far, it's worth spending a little more to get a quality instrument.\n",
            "538 Bought a 3 pack. Liked em so much I bought three more.\n",
            "539 these things are cheapo plastic.  i was very disappointed with the flimsy feel.  i added a photo of my Audio Technica 2020 loaded in one of these cheapo mounts.  the description said metal construction. it is not.  beware of this thing.  the more I look at it the sadder I get.  junk.\n",
            "540 I played a wedding today using the Alaska picks on my thumb and ring finger.  They were very comfortable and stayed on my finger well without being to tight.  For my fingers I cut the extra piece off and just used the smaller part.  It fits snug under my nail and is the perfect length. For my thumb I used the full size of the pick and it worked great.  The material is easy to bend and shape using a file and buffing blocks.  This produces a naturally smooth sound that you can get with your nails.  I got the medium size. They fit great on all my fingers but I might try the larger version for my thumb but the medium works great if you bend the plastic back and it makes it looser around the thumb.\n",
            "541 Great product and price. I bought these panels for a home studio, mostly for mixing a tracking as I don't do much live recording there. There is definitely a difference and the early reflections from the monitors are lessened (to my ears anyway). They did the job I needed and they look good too! I opted to pin them to the wall with t-pins instead of using adhesive. For my use it works well and I can remove them with little or no damage to the wall. I ordered a second box to put in a pattern on the one remain wall that could use some treatment.\n",
            "542 I changed the pickguard on my MIM Tele to add a little bit of snap to it...white pickguards are a little dull...also changed the volume & tone knobs to match the finish...EZ upgrades on both...\n",
            "543 Superb feel and sound!\n",
            "544 This is a fine EQ.  It sounds good and I'm  thinking of getting another one  for right and left  speaker.\n",
            "545 Absolute BEST guitar hangers on the market... You will not beat this price! Buy them while you still can for this cheap\n",
            "546 Works as discribed. looks awesome.\n",
            "547 Not very thick, but it works and looks good!\n",
            "548 It seriously sounds better than it has any right to at this price range, and I love it.  Great if you want to do some recording in an area that is not sound treated that you can't get away with using a condenser microphone in.  It has a lot of character as it's frequency response is far from flat.  Attenuation of the lows and a pretty beefy boost in the presence without going too bright.  It's a bit louder that the Shure sm58, but not hugely.  Still needs quite a bit of preamp, about 70% up on my preamp to remain in unity on my mixer for reasonable recording levels.  It's got a good sound to it.  I think it's super short sighted of Behringer to fail to include the frequency profile of this microphone on the Amazon store page, but don't worry I've got you all covered.  The picture attached is a document included with my microphone which SHOULD have been on this store page, and will give you an idea of what this microphone will sound like.\n",
            "549 I really wanted this pedal to work out for me but I am really disappointed in the external footswitch. So I am giving it one star so others are made aware of error in owners manual.\n",
            "550 This pickguard is wonderful, didn't have to mod it in any way, and I was concerned because the old one on the guitar is bigger then this one.  Thought I would have some visible holes on the guitar but nope it fit like a glove. Now I have a great looking guitar, oh let's don't forget the price.  Very low price, awesome product came with screws most don't so why buy a name brand at 5 times the cost.\n",
            "551 Simple to install and it works. I have an old Ibanez RG that I just didn't want to fuss with as far as tuning adjustments. Installed this with an extra spring and really tightened up the claw into the body, works as advertised. The coolest part is how you can set your bridge height before the final claw adjustment. Can still dive if I want but I'm just having fun playing the RG again in alternative tuning. I can go from 1/2 step down Van Halen right back up to standard leads w/o having to access the cavity. I may get a Tremol-no for my American Strat as I feel this is too limiting for a more expensive guitar.\n",
            "552 Great nylon strings, just as expected. They worked just fine on my daughter's mini classical guitar. They are as good quality wise as much more expensive strings I've purchased in the past. They are much softer to the touch and easier for her to learn on than my steel strings on my acoustic guitar. They came labeled with both the note name and the string number, which made putting them on easy and quick.\n",
            "553 Well... I guess the truth is this product is not for everyone.\n",
            "554 I actually picked up this bass at my local guitar center used, for $60! I brought it home, wiped it down with some dunlop guitar polish, cleaned and treated the fretboard with lemon oil, and put on a D'Addario Light set of strings. I have $75 invested, and it plays amazing! I've played it through numerous cabs, and record with it. Very happy. Check through the used section at GC first if you don't mind a quick cleaning and restring to save you $125!\n",
            "555 These strings were reccomended to me by an acquaintance of mine during a bass clinic I attended recently.  I ordered them right away.. All i can say is WOW! Excellent tone. It really brightened up my sound. I had gotten used to muddy sounding strings.  I haven't noticed a sticky feeling like others have mentioned, mine are silky smooth. Great playability. Wasn't too concerned about color, But When I installed them on my Ferrari red Carvin LB 70, I fell in love with my bass all over again.  It looks stunning, and I get many comments about my bass now..Others have mentioned that the color wears off quickly, but I don't care, I'll used the color wear as a guage of when to change them..Then neon ones even glow brightly under a black light.  Bass players don't get much credit so why not give them a show and something to talk about.\n",
            "556 I am impressed with this pedal. It works quite well, especially with a guitar ran through it for key reference. We have used it for many different applications, and different styles, and it seems to work under most conditions. I really enjoy the variation you have at your disposal with this pedals settings. You can have 1 or 2 lines of harmony, and you can chose whether they are each higher or lower, and between a 3rd and a 5th or the root note. The ability to control those factors makes a world of difference. I would recommend checking out some of the demo review videos if you are interested in this pedal.\n",
            "557 I loved using this while producing videos with my Canon EOS 6D, but it didn't last long.  When I inserted the battery into the receiver, one of the battery contacts broke off.  Here are some pictures of the receiver mounted on my EOS 6D and a picture showing the broken contact wire.  The battery holder has a bad design because the contacts are weak wire loops and the battery fits very snug and puts a lot of pressure on these weak contacts.  Samson should update the battery holder design.  I still recommend this wonderful wireless system, just something to be aware of.\n",
            "558 I am wanting to replace the stock single coil neck pickup in my 2016 Squier Affinity with a humbucker. This should do just fine. The mounting screws match up perfectly. Cheers!\n",
            "559 Bought this case for a 650mm classical guitar. There is some spare room around the body of this guitar. In the picture attached, you can see a box of strings (3/4\"), fits in between the guitar and case, but with the lid closed, the guitar doesn't move around, it feels secure.\n",
            "560 Great microphone, I use it with my cheap/budget Behringer mixer, the sound is good and if I turn up the gain it will pick up everything in the room. It is great for recording acoustic guitar and vocals, don't start layering the vocals though, it starts to sound kind of weird.\n",
            "561 I was looking for an second inexpensive ukulele for traveling or camping.  To my surprise this is a wonderful ukulele!  Its light weight construction makes its tone warm, bright and rich.  The construction on the instrument is very high quality.  If your looking for a beautifully designed comfortable playing ukulele, look no more.  Even the etching on the body is very nice.  Luna makes a few other designs in this etched series.  So if you don't like this design there are others to choose from.  I would highly recommend Luna's Mahogany Mo's Concert Ukulele to anyone who wants a high quality ukulele without spending a lot of money. And it even comes with a nice soft Luna case.\n",
            "562 Great little pedal with tons of tone! For anyone having noise issues with this guy, put it in the front of your signal chain. It doesn't like sitting behind other gain pedals (very typical big muff trait) put a clean boost behind it and it really goes!\n",
            "563 I was a little skeptical about this case but I went for it. It's for my rented violin that I just picked up. I travel for a living and looking for an alternative to the hard case the violin came in. This one is made of very high quality material, super light, and quality seems great. Fits the 4/4 like a glove and there's room for two bows, rosin compartment and an outer pouch that fits my shoulder rest. Comes with two straps that can make the case be used as a backpack, also came with the cloth to put on top of violin. Love it love it!\n",
            "564 Very easy to put on and looks very realistic and are worth every penny I highly suggest if you want to make your Epiphone look like a Gibson guitar\n",
            "565 I am building a recording studio. Every studio I've been to; you always expect a humongous mixer, a mac, very expensive condenser mic, and black mic cables. I wanted something unique and different. The connectors are sold and very nice! Cable is thick and sturdy. When I bend the cable I don't feel wires moving around inside. Very well made! You will like these cables!\n",
            "566 So far so good. These speakers have a great flat sound for audio MIXING and MASTERING. They can get louder than I thought from the reviews I've read. I'm in a full basement and these are perfect.\n",
            "567 Perfect- the blue is outstanding. Had it customized. Take a close gander at this masterpiece\n",
            "568 Wow! This is a beautiful looking instrument, solidly made, with a nice rich and bright tone, and all for only 38 bucks! Worth every penny and more!\n",
            "569 Prior reviews describing concerns about the handle on this case are accurate.  I bought this case new from GC less than a year ago, have never had it out of my studio, and the handle molding over ball joint is crumbling and falling apart (see photo).  This is not due to abuse, climate or bad design ... it's junk plastic.  Too bad - the fit and finish of this case is perfect for my Gibson Les Paul R8 VOS. I love the design and light weight, but there's no way I'd risk carrying my guitar in it now.  The handle is going to fail at any moment.\n",
            "570 Great fun,and,if you get a Whammy pedal,and ANY BLOODY DELAY(echo pedal),this is cool! if you add more,and run it thru a big amp,AWESOME!\n",
            "571 This is a beautiful, sturdy and easy to install hardwood hanger. The set arrived in great condition with all necessary parts including a quality wall anchor, should you need some. To install this set you need a screwdriver and a drill. This is made in USA and the high quality shows. No funny smells, either.\n",
            "572 Love these Strap Locks.  Easy, fast installation, and they work perfectly.  Have purchased a number of them.  Highly recomemded.\n",
            "573 This is everything you want in a fuzz box.  Mid scoop, custom-dialed mid boost or additional cut, bass boost, noise gate, and a special attack knob to add in certain frequencies to give attack back to the muff sound, if desired.  EHX listened to a decade of online feedback on the NYC 3-knob Big Muff Pi and added every must-have addition into a single pedal.\n",
            "574 Just what inwas specting to keep my mobile recording studio on the go. Don't let the \"cable bag\" fool you, this bag can keep more than just cables and is pretty customizable.  I recommend using it with khanka bags to give extra protection even though the bag is sturdy enough but to keep equipment more in place nice and tight. I would've preffered buying the large size but for now im happy with this one. I would recommend this to a friend and would buy another one again!\n",
            "575 I was surprised when I discovered this mic delivers XLR quality recording. I originally bought it for recording sessions during travel but it stacks up well against a 2x as expensive Rhode XLR mic! I would definitely recommend this mic to anyone looking for a good USB mic.\n",
            "576 great durable case, just like what others have said. it comes with screws n some washers. simple easy to work with.\n",
            "577 Worked ok in a pinch as a last minute purchase.  All of my amp rack patch panels have Neutrik NL4MP connectors, as most of my speakers.  I have some monitors with 1/4\" inputs which I am swapping out with Neutrik NL4MPs.  So no more 1/4\"inputs and no more knock offs for me.  No I will NOT purchase this product again. (Photo shows 'my custom made' 12/4 cable connected to OEM cable connector and panel mount).\n",
            "578 It's perfect, although it's not the simplest of portable stands with its number of parts\n",
            "579 I have four of these I purchased at my local guitar shop didn't buy from amazon. They are the exact same cables however and I think they are far too stiff and rigid. Example you can see visible wrinkles and feel the tension work against you when plugging these into pedals. I mean quite a bit of resistance as in unnecessary amount. Durable yes and that's great but I'm running a pedalboard for guitars Not pullin trucks out of mud pits damn. They do sound okay but nothing special. Look pretty cool too but looks aren't what's getting it done. Overpriced in my opinion as are most fender cables. Not a huge fan and prefer lower profile pancake type patch cables mogami sounds better , easier to work with and the pedals can be kept much neater and closer to save space. That means room for \"more toys!\" Hooked a few pedals together off the board and took a couple pics so you can get an idea of the tension and overall in my opinion sloppy fit of these cables.\n",
            "580 This is not a sturdy stand. This is probably not suitable for a school band room. It is a lightweight, foldable and easily stashed stand that barely holds a three ring binder with 50 pages of fake tab. But it does manage to do this. That's all I wanted. I can keep it folded up and out of the way next to the couch and take it out when I need it. Hands down beats the previous music stand I was using: the floor.\n",
            "581 Excellent with CAD U37 Microphone\n",
            "582 Excellent 2 tier keyboard stand.  It did exactly what I needed it to do, if fact came out better than expected.  Hard to believe it's only $27.  See the before and after photos.\n",
            "583 I received this and a InnoGear Studio Recording Condenser Microphone in exchange for an honest review, and I have to say as a podcaster and host of a radio show that I am able to do online this works amazing well.\n",
            "584 I do like these strings! Are they the best? There are so many personal preferences. Have you ever asked a drummer what double bass drum pedal they like? It is all too subjective, but I can tell you I have so far liked the quality and feel of the Super Slinky Pink!\n",
            "585 I put one of these cheap ass pickups in a kit guitar I built, and it sounds amazing!! No noise at all, and nice clear clean sound, and perfectly crunchy with distortion. Yes!!\n",
            "586 This is the second one Ive purchased, and I have ZERO complaints! These are amazing for hanging guitars. (Ive even got a mini one for my ukulele!) I would recommend these to everyone!!!\n",
            "587 These are great little stands. They are perfect for a \"wherever you need it\" stand. I have one next to my PC studio,making the guitar I'm using closer than my regular 5 guitar stand across the room ,and the other next to my bed (so i always have a guitar handy before and after i sleep ). These are really an amazing value and they hold guitars secure enough for me not to worry about them falling over...Holds my classical acoustics, stratocasters, and jazz bass perfectly....\n",
            "588 This case is rigid yet lightweight. There seems to be plenty of padding (high density Styrofoam?).  In regards to the various sizes, I bought the \"Electric\" size and it fits my new Fender Strat perfectly.  A Fender Strat fits snugly without shifting around.  NOTE:  If you have a Les Paul style guitar, make sure to buy the \"Les Paul\" case.  If you buy this Electric case, which is what I am reviewing here,  your Les Paul will NOT fit!  Inside the case there are a couple of areas where you can put a couple of effects pedals, etc.  If you use mini-pedals, you might be able to fit four.  On the outside there is a large, zippered pocket that will fit a small laptop.  Plus, another zippered pocket that has see-thru mesh material.  The zippers are large and heavy duty.  This case is much easier to carry than your typical hard case.  Plus, it looks classy.  I'm glad I bought it.\n",
            "589 Fabtastic build quality and a very rich fuzzy goodness. Very surprised and not a let down at all. Light fuzz for some distored blues heavy fuzz for some unaudible grunge ruckus not meant to be perceived. Get it or be square, or a circle, or a rhombus. Im not your boss.\n",
            "590 I've bough a few of these. They work good. Not sure what else to say. They are not cheap-looking and hold the violin and the bow on the wall the way they should.\n",
            "591 Really. With this, there is no need for a pedaltrain pedal board. The build quality is the same and you can buy different sizes. The only con I can think of is that they don't provide a small strip of velcro for the bottom part of the board... Yet they provide velcro, most other boards don't.\n",
            "592 Was purchased 6-meter cable I had received was only 1.8 meters I think there is a mistake in the shipment\n",
            "593 I put these strings on an acoustic guitar I recently acquired and they sound great. I was going to try Eric Clapton signature strings but decided I wanted a lighter gauge and ordered these.\n",
            "594 Just got this today and I was pleasantly surprised by the whole package!  Well made case, legs and instrument.  This is my 2nd lap steel, my first was a Recording King.  I'm as pleased if not more because my RK did not have the screw on legs and has a better case and was a bit cheaper.  I will buy another in the future!\n",
            "595 The product description is entirely accurate. Great pickups for my RG Ibanez.\n",
            "596 I will be switching ALL of my snare drums to this head. Why?\n",
            "597 My experience with these have turned out great!\n",
            "598 Great stand for the money, very sturdy you will be happy.\n",
            "599 Nicely made, very secure, very plush on the inside.  And a bit heavy, but it keeps the guitar safe from my klutzy self.\n",
            "600 They came tarnished and discolored, I assume because they were clipped in during storage and shipping, see the pictures. They work with Schallers so you don't have to worry about compatibility and I guess they'll be covered up when I'm playing out, so it's not really that big of a deal but I'm still kind of disappointed. They're also quite a bit bigger but I'm not sure if I hate this, obviously I'm used to smaller Schallers however the larger washer means a more secure connection with my strap and more gold flair. I dunno, I'm still too disappointed with the discoloration.\n",
            "601 Awesome bass. I love it. As some other reviewers have commented this bass is not balanced as a standard solid body bass. the neck is definitely heavier due to the hollow body, but you know, that's the way it goes. I love the sound the hollow body gives you sounds a bit like my acoustic bass. The controls give a nice variety of sounds. I am something of a novice player but wanted to add a hollow body bass to my small collection and this Hofner replica is just the ticket. I think I might replace the strings that it came with as they sound a too metallic for my taste, but they are playable and hold tune well. I was able to play this bass right out of the box once I tuned it. No need for adjusting and didn't have that fret buss some reviewers have commented on. I did notice the neck is slimmer and the strings are closer together than any of my other basses, so that is an adjustment, but didn't take long to get into the swing of things. Fun to play and lightweight. Recommended.\n",
            "602 Mine were very stiff and hard to tune, no smoothness, like there was dirt or grit in the gears.  After installing one of the tuning keys got super stiff and before I could get up to tune the head snapped off.  Had to return entire set...pain in the azz.  Not worth the money in savings, going with Hipshots next.\n",
            "603 Looks amazing paired with the Neewer white/black mic boom arm and whiteout Blue Yeti mic!  Can definitely hear the difference with and without the filter.\n",
            "604 I have been playing for about 25 years on all kinds of gear. My Armand ride and hats never change, The crashes do from time to time. thought I would try a Wuhan crash. it sounds so good. I am so pleasantly surprised. The sound is bright and warm at the same time. the decay is not fast, but not too long either. Even the bell sounds good. I just ordered an 18 Gong crash and a 10 splash. I'll let you know!\n",
            "605 Squier Vintage Modified Jazz Bass.\n",
            "606 Its flimsy and for the awkward angles it sticks in a guitar the Vox device should be metal and sturdy, especially for price.  Mine broke within a week and I am a just a living room player.  I don't know how it broke but it did.  I will upload pictures.\n",
            "607 The neck had the most amazing finish.\n",
            "608 The paint job on this control plate is terrible, the paint is uneven and it even have \"bubble\" like sections.\n",
            "609 After trying to get by without it, I can't imagine trying to use my wah unattached any more. This thing is incredible for attaching a wah to a pedalboard. I just wish they made something just like this for all of my pedals. It's so much more secure than the sticky back stuff.\n",
            "610 This pair of Samson GT Studio Monitors was a great start for me, they aren't your loudest speakers, but they still pack a punch. They can still be mixed on, and give a good all around frequency response. What you want to be careful of is the bass, and mixing bass on these because they will not provide all of the bass that is really there. They are great for mids. The portability is amazing! Along with the fact that you will NOT need an audio interface with these! The Mic plugs directly into the speaker! What a easy and accessible way for an artist to record his vocals, or for a guitarist to to record his notes. Definitely a good investment!\n",
            "611 This box does everything I need it to. It's passive, so it doesn't color the sound, it makes for easy switching between my two sets of monitors, and even has an auxiliary input (RCA connection) with separate volume control (which I use to patch in an xbox. Gotta take 5 from working every once in a while!). The main volume knob is really smooth and has some slight resistance, which makes it feel great when dialing in levels.\n",
            "612 Deep tone and I'm a fan!\n",
            "613 These speakers sound great! I've had a pair of cube Auratone reference monitors for 30 yrs that still sound great but these iLouds are another level. Strong bass, crystal clear mids and highs. They are computer speakers on steroids! The pairing of inboard amp matched perfectly with the drivers makes sure you are getting great sound. They are Bluetooth capable too which I didn't even notice at first because it isn't stated loudly on the package. They aren't inexpensive but neither are good microphones and guitars. If you can afford the price, you will be pleased. Luckily my girlfriend gave me mine for Christmas :) Thank You Love!\n",
            "614 Great value for a hard case, holds lots of guitars, including jaguar, or even a Les Paul. Only issue is... that there's not enough padding,  and some guitars might knock around if You don't add some additional support.\n",
            "615 I Fit 9 Guitars in this. The 2 outside Pads Support 2 more on Stage! It was Cheap compared to Most Stands that Cost $75.00 to $100.00\n",
            "616 Fits my AT2035 like a glove. It DOES cover the entire grill (see picture), just took a little careful finagling to get it on. As some reviewers have said, it does come in a little baggy pressed flat. Mine has expanded nicely in just an afternoon. Doubt if there's much better for my mic at the same price. Highly recommend.\n",
            "617 I like this little small light! It fits in your hand and is a decent output of light. It is dmx which we all know is awesome! Dmx makes the world a little easier to control! The colors are red green blue and white. The only thing I do not like is the way the colors are mixed, you can see the outside of the color when you mix them. I would put one quad led in the fixture so it's all under one lense and there's no bleeding. But other than that this fixture is awesome!\n",
            "618 I've used this for 3 years every Halloween and it always has worked well for me.  After each use, I rinse the tank out with distilled water, then run the unit until just steam comes out, then I dump the water and store the unit dry.  I've heard of people who think you should store the units full of fog juice, but I've heard of people who say the pump gets gunky if you do that.\n",
            "619 This stereo audio jack splitter worked smoothly for me, allowing me to connect 2 headphones to one audio output and also to connect an audio output from a music keyboard to a PC and headphones simultaneously. It's inexpensive and came without any instructions or retail packaging, while it was fine for my needs.\n",
            "620 Wow this thing is so cool I play it threw two orange 8\" cabs it is my favorite practice amp by far. Three knows zero bull $#!+. Once I turn it up around 2 my dog starts to howl no joke I really goes. I'm going to try jamming with it here soon and see how it contends with my brute of a drummer. It can go from clean to pretty dirty but if you really want to get nasty you will need a nice hot humbucker and a distortion pedal. I dug it's sound I didn't bother with a pedal for the first week. Can't go wrong for the price. The little tube in the preamp does really make it sound good.\n",
            "621 Tried a number of noise gates, including the EHX silencer.  This one blows them all away.  Wanted a gate that would allow me to roll off my volume knob in crunch mode and still gate.  This is the only one that really works.  Get it!\n",
            "622 Exactly what I needed to give my studio professional sound quality. Also fairly easy to install, I suggest using t-pins either 1.5in or 2in. Overall very happy with it.\n",
            "623 Can't really complain too much for the price. Had a little spot where the paint had flaked off with some rust underneath, and a couple of the 1/4\" jacks are a little loose in the center (when I tried to tighten the nut, the whole center part of the jack rotated), but overall they're decent. Got all the terminals soldered together and mounted the crossover right to the plate, and everything seems to work just fine.\n",
            "624 Many people think that a electric guitar for around 100 bucks is cheap and sounds terrible. this guitar makes that opinion wrong. this guitar is amazing for the price. the first part of the guitars character you notice is the beautiful red color. it looks beautiful and is really eye catching. the playability is nice with a good action. the strings it comes with are decent factory strings but i changed them anyway for better sound. the volume and tone knobs are cool looking also. the tune o matic bridge helps alot and kept my guitar in tune for days. this guitar also comes with a amp cable , some papers, owners guide, a poster and a big epiphone sticker. who doesnt love stickers? lol. i highly recommend this guitar to beginners and those who have been playing for a while. the sound quality is amazing for the price you get.\n",
            "625 This is my absolute favorite guitar strap amongst those I've purchased.  I'm using it with an antique German lute guitar (wandervogellaute), and the stained glass pattern complements the carved rosette of the sound hole in a vaguely ecclesiastical motif -- while still looking a little hippie.  The lute guitar is extremely lightweight, so I can't speak to how well the strap would hold up a heavy solid body electric guitar, but it seems to be very sturdily made, and is definitely comfortable.\n",
            "626 I really like the simplicity of this bridge. It adjusts easy for string height and length. It comes with all the mounting screws and even a small allen wrench to make the height adjustments. The provided mounting screws are Phillips head screws. The one thing that I missed when I ordered this was the fact that it is not a bridge for string-thru the guitar body placement. The strings dead end to the stop-flair of the plate. I included a picture of this so it may help to make others aware that it is not for string-thru applications. No biggie tho for me, I will use it on another project now.\n",
            "627 They are nice picks but much smaller than they appear in your photos!\n",
            "628 Perfect fit on my 2016 Gibson Les Paul Studio Faded.  I didn't like the original speed knobs because they were too big and clunky-feeling. I was skeptical about these knobs after reading some reviews about poor quality, but I think they're very high quality.  The finish is perfect on them:  No seams, scratches, chips, etc.  I don't know what more someone could expect quality-wise.\n",
            "629 This is the second Neewer boom arm I have purchased, as I have added a second recording capable computer to my battle station for my son to be able to record voice and gameplay. I was pleasantly surprised to see the one thing I disliked about mine had been changed. The mount that attaches to your desk has received an upgrade, allowing for a tighter fit on the boom arm stalk, and a more robust build of the mount overall. My previous mount had a D-shaped hole the boom arm stalk slipped into, which allowed for a lot of movement regardless of how tight you made the clamping screw. It was also equipped with an oversized plastic wingnut for securing the mount to the desk. The upgraded mount rectifies both those issues.\n",
            "630 I received this pedal as a gift.  A compressor is a subtle effect, but it has made a great addition to my pedal board.  The construction of the pedal is solid.  It adds character to chords and enhances leads.  I am currently using the pedal with the sustain at 1 o'clock, the attack at noon, and the volume at 10 o'clock.  The volume provides a very strong boost after 11 o'clock.  Overall, good pedal for the price.\n",
            "631 I wanted something light and compact that can hold a few items, but also fit well in a carry-on and protect the jamstik indoors or out. This case is the perfect solution, and has a nice, adjustable strap as well. Good  durable construction and love having the jamstik label to show it off!\n",
            "632 This was a great value. The wood I received looked outstanding and all the parts were there and fit well. I did some customization to the look and added a couple of other pickups for some diversity but the components I received were of reasonable quality. The guitar looks and plays great after a bit of neck adjustment and setup. Very satisfied.\n",
            "633 There are only a few things I needed to know before I purchased this Alto/Tenor stand.  1.  Did it hold my Tenor and Soprano properly? 2.  Would this particular stand work properly on different surfaces? 3.  Is the design portable and easy for setup for gigs/home use to easily swap for doubled soprano?\n",
            "634 Never levelled frets before I picked this thing up. The concept seemed simple enough. I figured that, due to the weight of this block, little to no pressure would be required and that was a good call.\n",
            "635 This is a very nice Crash / Ride Cymbal. I'm using it for a smaller kit I'm using for a school I'm working at. The kids seem to enjoy the sound, and it's taking a beating. Its holding up to the challenge.\n",
            "636 I had this put together in less than 5 minutes, and made my 3-guitar stand a 4-guitar stand.\n",
            "637 The direct drive assembles and mounts easily. It works well with the right foot and is responsive. Also, it adjusts easily for travel and mallet through. It provides a distinct bass sound freeing up your two hands on the Cajon. It will provide more of a drum kit sound particularly if your Cajon has string sound.\n",
            "638 This is a great, sturdy stand.  I'm using it for a classical and a flamenco guitar, and they are very secure in the stand.  It's also easy to lift either guitar out without banging one into the other even while seated.  I've also set a concert ukulele in the double stand with no problem.\n",
            "639 I bought this stand for church because I been blessed with a soprano and a alto sax and its realy good and reliable and fit in the front poutch of my sax case with no problems (my alto case has a exstra poutch in the front) but one little thing is that the peg can fit a soprano but its just a little lose but it still is safe for soprano sax.\n",
            "640 This pedal is a Tube Screamer, or more correctly an exact replica. When mine came in the mail, I took it out of the box, plugged in my 300ma neg pin power supply, and immediately created a warm, old tube amp tone. I need to get a new, daisy chain chord, so I can use all my pedals at once, but I have no noise issues (those who do have ground loop issues). I also used a pen to push in the two pedal flap hinge pins to remove it and expose the battery compartment. Anyone who removes the Phillips screws to disassemble the pedal (removing the bottom) obviously has problems understanding directions. I will not, however, ever be using batteries.\n",
            "641 I have two of these.  They are rock solid.  I have never had a problem with them, at all.  Very easy to attach to a wall.  Find a stud or use heavy drywall anchors.  I got ones that screw right into the wall and this setup works great.\n",
            "642 Now all I have to do is install these on my Burswood Strat Copy. I know I'm gonna have to drill holes for the locating pins I may even have to drill the tuner holes also. Look forward to getting those crappy, loose, un-smooth, original hardware tuners off this thing.\n",
            "643 We used this one in the middle as seen in the picture holding the white guitar. BIG MISTAKE! The guitar almost was destroyed. This is NOT strong enough to hold a 7 string Schecter Omen guitar. While it worked out and seemed secure at first. Literally 7 days later the guitar had almost fell to the floor. I wouldn't recommend this for heavier guitars. Instead we will be keeping the guitar in the stand where it is safer.\n",
            "644 Great looking additions! !!\n",
            "645 This is real bone. Took a while to file them down to lower the action and replace the plastic parts on a cheap guitar.  But it has improved the sound quality immensely. Well worth it!\n",
            "646 I'm a guitar player who sometimes needs to play bass.  My brother bought me for Christmas.  I was pleasantly surprised by this guitar's feel and sound when unplugged!  It FEELS solid and has great sustain unplugged!  It played easy right out of the box though I will eventually get it set up but I'm not in a rush.  With this gift came a Fender Rumble 25 bass amp that for what I need is perfect and sounds great.  I'm very impressed overall and would recommend this bass to someone looking for a quality instrument without the \"quality\" price tag.\n",
            "647 If you own a J45 these are strings for that guitar. I have a J45 custom and I have tried other strings, but these give it that Gibson sound.\n",
            "648 Using this to get complete control over my signal going into in-ear monitors\n",
            "649 Was excited to get this case at a great price. It was very disappointing to receive the case and find that it would not close and latch completely right out of the box. The top and bottom case just don't seem to fit together right. Seems to be bad quality control.\n",
            "650 So strange this happens on a brand new set of strings. This brand used to be trusted by me.\n",
            "651 While I wasn't sure this would fit my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9, I was pleasantly surprised. Whats impressive is how secure my iPad feels in the grip of the two sets of prongs.\n",
            "652 Was hoping it would be half in longer. Hohner does not seem to carry a size to fit a \"full orchestra\" 40 read model\n",
            "653 Great sound and clarity fair warning use head phones when recording because feed back is a butt\n",
            "654 hello this isa great bass comin from a seasonal 40 something year old i love this bass it has a nice warm tone don't let this price fool ya get off your easy chair and buy this already  its not cheap in a lot of ways very durable and i said it first good for gigs not a starter bass like its called this will hold up thanks alot\n",
            "655 I have uses many condenser microphones in my time and this is the best product I have used. This is now my go to mic. The sound is amazing!!! I have a very deep voice and sing or talking on this mic you can really make out my baritone voice. I highly recommend this product for the beginner to the professional. What a wonderful mic at a great price.\n",
            "656 I love everything Aguilar does, this tlc really makes the difference. Love it\n",
            "657 The cheap black screw broke.\n",
            "658 Wow what a difference from bare fingers. Really nails the tones down with very little effort. Very smooth metal and plastic. Large fit my mits well. Barely opened the middle finger and that was it. Been picking for hours and haven't had and movement so far. I'm a 6'3\" skinny guy so large hands but skinny fingers. Large was perfect. Right up to the first knuckle was snug and comfortable. The thumb picks are even better!\n",
            "659 I needed to replace poorly built, wobbly and ugly green Wilkinson tuners on my Vintage V100PGM ICON Lemon Drop Greeny guitar.\n",
            "660 I chose this beater just so that I could be more like Bonham.  It has replaced the stock Yamaha beater on my direct drive 9500 pedal.  It is very light and it feels great coming off the batter head.  I have not made any adjustments since swapping out the beater, but I am considering putting a little weight on the beater to make it feel a little more significant.  As far as sound, it's the old school thump.  With my 24\", it rings ever so beautifully.  This may not work so well for hard rock or metal.  Too much bong and not enough bop.\n",
            "661 I bought this for my monoprice les paul copy, as it doesn't come with a pickup selector plate or pickguard. I'm happy with the color and quality, it came with a bunch of screws and a pick. I didn't need the backplates, but they are the right size. For the price I'm happy, as the pickguard alone can run anywhere from $10-20.\n",
            "662 Great little compact mixer. Super versatile. Loving it for my basement studio.\n",
            "663 This is the second ChromaCast hard guitar case that I have purchased and I like both of them! I needed a hard case for my Schecter OMEN-6 guitar. I find myself playing this guitar more and more. I had bought a Schecter hard guitar case from Amazon Warehouse Deals but it didn't fit my guitar (the description said it would). I emailed ChromaCast and they said the CC-EHC case would work. It's a really nice case! It's a good value for the price. I saw the bad reviews for this guitar case and I can tell you that have not had a problem with either one of my cases.\n",
            "664 Purchased after studying the reviews on quality, which is accurate for this mount. It timely arrived. The center mike holder opening is for a much larger microphone than the ATR 2100, that I own. The 2100 indicates 51mm, but that is at the mike area, not the trunk which is much smaller and used for mounting to the shock mount. After researching a replacement in the same price range, I found none. I had some foam pipe insulation for 1/2 inch pvc pipe in the utility room. This is readily available from most any big box hardware store.  I cut the foam about 4\" in length and placed the 2100 in the foam. It fits perfect. I didn't seal the foam, but it is just right and tight in the mount holder. I now have a shock mount that can be used if, and when, I purchase a larger microphone. I have attached a photo. After the image was created, I further trimmed the foam length to match the actual size of the mounting holder opening.  This shock mount is a quality product at a great price.\n",
            "665 This is the worst fitting junk I have ever seen! The pickgaurd is to big and the back plates are to small and the holes do not line up. I could make the pick guard work but it would take time with a drimel to make sure it fit properly without any gaps. The back plates are almost a full 1/4 inch off. waste of time and money.\n",
            "666 Very awesome strap! It looks exponentially cool! Leather ends are supple enough to install to strap buttons easily. Strap itself is really soft, so it doesn't irritate your shoulders and neck while you're playing your guitar. It adjusts pretty easy to your desired length. Buckle is plastic. You may or may not have an issue with that. I personally didn't. It looks amazing, and that's putting it kindly. I've gotten many compliments on it already. Definitely worth the money. As a back story, I was born on the year of the Dragon, so it's only fitting I bought this strap.\n",
            "667 Exactly what I needed, and worked for all different sized instruments. Created the perfect wall piece for my music room. Acoustic, electric, classical and two different size ukuleles. Perfect!\n",
            "668 Great for tuning a lap harp that we got for 5 bucks at a yard sale. The brand in Russian is \"Perepolotchka\" and the back of the harp says \"Made in USSR\". We were so pleased to find this!\n",
            "669 Amazing quality. Stays in tune. Love everything about it!\n",
            "670 This is great sounding at a great price! Is it perfect? No, but it is no less perfect than something costing a lot more and not sounding as good as this pedal. I read one review in which the guy was not satisfied because he said it sounded like \"80's glam rock.\" I totally disagree. If you can play and have a decent amp - you can get a variety of great sounds out of this little box. It seems like so many players like a fuzzy, buzzy type overdrive sound. I prefer a thicker creamy sound and you can dial that up with this pedal. For a mere $35, I was willing to roll the dice - I found a diamond in the rough.\n",
            "671 This is a great cartridge.  It was easy to setup and has a very nice sound.  I also have a Shure m97xe, but I prefer the sound of this one.  Originally, I had issues with it.  The sound was muffled and flat.  To correct it, I reinstalled the stylus until it clicked onto the front.  Sounds great now.\n",
            "672 I bought it open box from online music store.\n",
            "673 <div id=\"video-block-RA7Z7GU9WEPDC\" class=\"a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block\"></div><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"\" value=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/D101XgCvTAS.mp4\" class=\"video-url\"><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"\" value=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91V1FqLj6KS.png\" class=\"video-slate-img-url\">&nbsp;Very surprised about the tone of power of such a small device.  I have also dropped it more than once and it has proven to be durable, as well.  I am actually using it as a practice bass amp and it sounds like playing a bass through a guitar amp, which is acceptable for practice.  I gave it to my guitar player to use and he was very impressed with the improvement in the product, having used other 9 volt practice amps in the past.  Can easily be used to amplify any personal sound needs by using or purchasing a 1/4\" input adapters.  It does not include a power adapter, which would have been a nice addition, so you have to use 9 volt batteries to power your practice sessions.  Watch my demonstration video.\n",
            "674 It's Digitech,if ya don't like it,your an idiot great stuff!,easy,great sounds I've still got my old Rp200-255 300!15years ago!,still going!!\n",
            "675 This pedal have been a good addition to my pedal board.  It did take some time to dial in the right mix and level.  I personally do not use the chorus and vibrato, but it does add a cool later to the sound.  The delay is very good and natural sounding.  This pedal is a great alternative to similar pedals that are much more expensive.\n",
            "676 Extremely impressed with this kit.\n",
            "677 (Review is based on using it with the PYLE PSMRS11 Acoustic Isolation Microphone shield, you can buy it as a package. I bought mine separately) It is one heavy duty mic stand, but I got it for holding up the PYLE PSMRS11 Acoustic Isolation Microphone shield and the damn shield was too heavy to hold in place!  It kept falling over. This mic stand was sold to hold the darn thing but it only works if you place the Isolation Shield in a certain direction (see picture). You must remove the rubber pads that are on the Microphone shield, if you don't you'll find your Isolation shield on the floor! The weight is too heavy for the rubber pads to hold them up (they are glued on). So you have to tighten metal to metal to hold the shield in place. You have to constantly check the tightening supports to make sure they don't pull the support stand down with it! You also have to remove the bottom metal desk supports from the Mic Shield to lighten the load on the Mic Stand. I hope this helps everyone using this for a Mic Shield.\n",
            "678 NICE.. Wish had a little bit more of Low end feel. Super loud.. Does the job.\n",
            "679 definitely a good purchase. nice and comfy for long sessions and the sound is crystal clear\n",
            "680 I have 3 of these now and I like that I can fit any type of guitar on there at the same time, even if they have straps on them. I have other stands that are spaced closer together and even a tremolo bar can get in the way. For those who have complained about no instructions being included, there are two bolts and 4 wheels. If you can't figure that out then maybe putting stuff together isn't your thing.\n",
            "681 The Head piece is a little wobbly but it's overall sturdy. Holds my guitar grimoire just fine and it's on the heavy side .\n",
            "682 Easy as heck to put on, In my opinion better than sperzel. These took literally 10 minutes to put on my  MIM strat.\n",
            "683 If you're looking for mixer to really get busy when it comes to scratching, mixing, or whatever, trust me you need to jump on this mixer right here.\n",
            "684 Did not notice when I ordered this that are no holes pre drilled for the pickup?  When trying to drill prep the product it simply cracked.\n",
            "685 Items work, but the description doesn't match the product. These are not RGBW Led, they were instead RGB.\n",
            "686 This is horrible, poorly made stand. Chinese knock-off quality. Probably the worst quality hardware item I've bought in years, and I own many crappy Dixon cymbal stands. The wingnuts look like stock items in 1950's budget sets. The main tube OD is MAYBE 1/2\". Just atrocious. If I were Mapex, I wouldn't put my name on this. I'd return it, but I'm only using it for a practice pad, so I guess it will do. Spend another $20 and get something decent.\n",
            "687 This is for my son in his rehearsal room and they are perfect! Great quality, arrived within a few days and the price you cant beat!\n",
            "688 Not bad at all for the price.  Cheaper on Amazon than ebay.  Installation was straight forward after watching some youtube videos.  I would watch out for the EXACT shape when cutting the holes in the body.  The larger piece has a couple of 'clipped' corners that need to be left on the body for the screws to grab.  Sounds great and the tuner is accurate.\n",
            "689 This is not Fretboard Oil Cleaner. It is pure magic! If you love your guitars and basses, you will purchase this immediately and start treating them with the love and care they deserve. It is sooooo easy to use, and a little goes a very long way. I recently worked on a mid '60s Harmony Rocket and the fretboard was, well, disgusting. I have included some before and after pics of the fretboard after crowning and polishing the frets and then cleaning it using Nomad. Judge for yourself.\n",
            "690 I love this pickguard, looks so cool on my red Telecaster, matches all the other chrome hardware, made of metal and does NOT scratch! Every one that sees my Telecaster loves it! Thanks! Good price also, saw several other sellers with this product, this seller had the best price by far! Packaged VERY well and delivered in a timely manner!\n",
            "691 I think this is good, the range of height is too short for the price. You can get a larger and heaviest for $1 or $2 more\n",
            "692 I originally installed these on my semi-hollow body Gretch D6128 Thunderbass in an attempt to cut down on the string and fret noise I was getting with conventional strings.\n",
            "693 Stretch them strings !\n",
            "694 I was able to install my new guitar hanger easily. I found a stud exactly where I wanted to install it, and I predrilled the holes to accommodate the two long wood screws; drywall anchors are included in the package.\n",
            "695 This bridge is beyond iconic and needed for any Telecaster build. Looks beautiful on any body that you put it on!\n",
            "696 But don't let that deter you. That just means it will break-in that much more quickly. My favorite strap is not padded in any way, like this strap, but a little wider. I use this on a Telecaster and it looks nice and matches well with the color scheme of the guitar. I hooked a couple&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/4pcs-Round-Head-Strap-Locks-Black-for-Guitar-Schaller-style/dp/B009FX3LTU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">4pcs Round Head Strap Locks Black for Guitar Schaller-style</a>&nbsp;on it and away we went. The strap is made in Canada from decent quality leather(not bonded) and the gold Fender logo is understated, yet classy. It's a classic strap from Fender. What else is there to say?\n",
            "697 I purchased these for a Cigar Box Guitar, they work great for that purpose.  I have no complaints.\n",
            "698 The mixer has good build. Knobs, and sliders are smooth. Buttons click with no crackling. It is quite.. no hiss. (Unless turn pre-amps wide open). I'm not a big fan of RCA jacks..but it is portable. Best pick compared to other battery powered mixers IMO. Mixer is on top/left of pedalboard in the pics. I had to used RCA right angle adapters so would fit in the pedalboard case.\n",
            "699 This case was bought for my Epiphone Les Paul Black Beauty 3 which fits inside pretty well, although there is a little wiggle room. The case appears to be built well, however, the case lid is misaligned with the base section when closed shut. The lid should overlap the bottom case similar to how a shoe box lid fits on top of its box. The misalignment creates an odd gap which is only noticeable upon close inspection. I have a similar Epiphone case for my Sheraton and that case closes properly like my shoe box example. So beware production quality may not be consistant and could vary on a case to case basis (I couldn't resist that pun).\n",
            "700 We opened the case and immediately saw the bow had strings visibly hanging off of it.  When we turned the latch to remove the bow to inspect it, we could see that several strings were caught in the the latch.  It took several minutes to carefully extracate it from the latch without breaking even more strings. Not sure if this was previously used and returned as new or just carelessly packed.  We haven't tuned it yet and will update our review on the actual violin later.  At this point, I am concerned.\n",
            "701 Fit my 1999 Taylor 414CE with only minor thinning.  Had to adjust for action height, of course.  Was twice the height it needed to be.  Works well.  Intonation is solid.  Sounds fine.  Noticeably more high end sparkle in the treble strings.\n",
            "702 My Les Paul guitar fits nicely in this gig bag, so does my stratocaster, it has 3 large zip up storage compartments for picks, tuners, sheet music, cords, strings, and more. Its nicely made and is rather protective for the guitar, the material isn't really soft so beware guitar scratches, but this gig bag is very nice, I'd recommend it to anyone needing a good quality gig bag.\n",
            "703 I cannot say enough good things about this particular guitar strap. I have several Walker & Williams straps and not a one of them is a loser, but when I pulled this out of the packaging yesterday, I immediately fell in love with it. Buttery smooth, real leather smell, nice stitching - just an overall quality piece of work. Looks beautiful on my Hagstrom. Couldn't be happier.\n",
            "704 This is a great stereo reverb with plenty of control to get the sounds I want. The toneprint is a great feature to check out the settings from some great artists. I am completely satisfied with the features and sound of this pedal and highly recommend it!\n",
            "705 You know, for a low-cost item, these do a pretty good job.  We are using them for filler lights to keep shadows down on the stage. My friend has an earlier version that does not include the fans and he had issues with them flickering due to overheating.  With the fans added, although noisy, it seems to eliminate the flickering issue.\n",
            "706 This kit is incredible !!  The quality is great for the investment.  I have been playing a Ludwig kit that is ok, but these are really higher quality. The finish and hardware are very nice, and maple is a plus also.\n",
            "707 Pretty simple perfect fit a little thicker than the original used it for a vintage modified 70s squire strat to give it an even more classic look. It was very easy to put on just watch a youtube video youll be fine. The black backplate adds a nice touch i have silver and black hardware so that worked out. I felt that the screws they gave me weren't as good as my originals. I did not use them. I think this product is a bit overpriced but thats probably because its laser etched. Adds a nice touch without seeming like you are trying to pass your guitar off for something more expensive. Here are some pictures.\n",
            "708 Can't say they look exactly like what's in the picture, especially since they don't have that gold ring around the center. However they're still perfectly usable, cheap, and still look neat on the guitar\n",
            "709 Perfect! Go get it don't delay, quick and easy install...........\n",
            "710 I have a 35 scale bass so I figured these strings would seem fitting. Well, I was wrong and forgot to account that my strings don't get feed through the bridge but get feed through the backside. The tapered part of the stings sit between the 1st fret and nut and causes it to buzz as seen in my photos. If you have a bass set up like mine, go with Ernie Balls.\n",
            "711 Installed these in my Ibanez  AS53 with no problem.  Probably not the application intended by the mfg, as they are intended to replicate active metal pickups. The Neck pickup is pretty dark, and lacks volume and clarity. The bridge pickup is louder, and brighter than the neck. I've had both better, and worse pickups... these are just alright. If I had it to do all over again, I probably would have just left the stock pickups in the guitar. It's not worth sending back, as the product does actually work, and tone is such a personal and subjective thing. I'm rating three stars as a neutral rating.\n",
            "712 Like these a lot. Easy install. Be sure to go to graphtech website and follow their instructions on how to check which model fits in your bridge, pro tip: glossy finishes can help you see the bottom side of your bridge without taking it off or using a little specialty mirror tool. Did I mention the things look damn sexy?\n",
            "713 Great material and very easy to work with. I cut this on my band saw with no issue and the surface cleans up very nice after cutting.\n",
            "714 A few weeks ago I bought the WP (white pearl) stickers which I really liked although I even said in my review that they have a slightly gray or silver cast to them. I just got another set, this time the AWP (aged white pearl) set and I'm glad I did. Tbhey do NOT look like stickers and you really can't tell unless you get your nose right on them. These actually look like aged pearl. They look freakin real. Check the image, it shows the WP set on the left and the AWP on the right. The pics aren't too good but good enough that you can see the difference..\n",
            "715 I have only had this pedal a few hours. It does what they say, maybe better than they say. I ran it through its paces with my Telecaster and was amazed. It can sound like the very costly Lesley pedals that go for near $400 but all that for only $50. I am happy, only 4 stars because I don't trust Behringer. I never had any of their stuff last that long.\n",
            "716 Excellent quality for the price. Can be trimmed to fit smaller speakers. I put two of them under my center channel on my home theater.\n",
            "717 Gibraltar makes good stuff...really good. But I have to return it as the inside diameter of the utility side of the bracket is 1 3/8 fully closed.\n",
            "718 I bought this bass to split time as my primary bass with my Dean Edge. This might be winning me over. The bass boost is outstanding. The active pickups really allow you to adjust to the sound you want. I recommend this for anyone. If you're a beginner  like I was not too long ago, it's an excellent bass to start with. If you're on tour and/or music is making you money, this bass will be beatiful on stage. The color is a bit darker than in the picture. But, all around, this is a great buy.\n",
            "719 I picked this up to help complete an overhaul of my '78 strat. Everything lined up perfectly, and this product was every bit as high quality as the original. Took just over 2 weeks to arrive (which was about what I was expecting). Very pleased with everything.\n",
            "720 The product was well packaged, and looks great right out of the box. The keys are full sized, and the keyboard is light without feeling cheap.\n",
            "721 After much online shopping, and 20 years of using traditional stands, I needed something with easier access and greater stability than the standard 3 leg stands. I had six guitars in stands, and this Hercules unit had the best reviews. The box arrived in great shape, and I pulled out the stand and popped it open and it was ready to go. Included was additional parts to add a 6th guitar to the stand, which I needed. Very easy to configure the spacing, and load the guitars, stable. Now it is easy for me to grab a guitar to play and then put away. I have an acoustic, 3 electrics, a semi-hollow body electric (E335 style), and a bass. Highly recommended.\n",
            "722 Well built.  Nice carrying case.  Comes with plenty of hook and loop.  I'd recommend getting some hook and loop cable ties instead of the plastic ones included.  The dimensions make the most sense of the different brand large boards that I looked at.  See pic for reference.\n",
            "723 I like em! Got a 3-pack, and now my cheap guitars don't have to sit on the floor. Easy to assemble, pretty sturdy. Almost knocked one over, and it righted itself impressively.\n",
            "724 Absolutely love it. Does exactly what I need it to do with utmost confidence. I can even shove 6 guitars, acoustic or electric IN CASES with this rack. Is it expensive? Yes, but is it worth it? Many times over.\n",
            "725 Hold tune ok, but string clamps loosen while tuning.\n",
            "726 At first, this would not work with the AT2020 USB+  microphone.  The pole is too thick to screw into the mount that comes with the mic.\n",
            "727 iT WOULD BE EASY TO BLAME THE GUITAR BUT sOME OF MY FELLOW MUSIANS HAVE TRIED IT WITH THERE GUITAR ANS SAME THING.. MOST PRO-NOUNCED ON THE HIGHEST STRINGS.. ALL THE STRINGS HAVE THE SAME VOLUME OR DYNAMICS. WHETHER I PLAY MY 335 OR MY SOUTHWESTERN. ACOUSTIC. THIS IS IMPORTANT TO ME AS I BUSK SOLO.\n",
            "728 awesome! i had the old mini, but this orientation had more useful space! pictured here is my board.\n",
            "729 Several items broken upon arrival. The fix was me gigging it up and not their fix. Warranty what warranty? Spend your money elsewhere. Very dissatisfied and disappointing to say the least. I've gotten better deals and service off Craigslist\n",
            "730 Sticks on great. It also holds on extremely tight. And when i take it of my finish is perfect\n",
            "731 Works & sounds beautifully. Would recommend this to anybody!\n",
            "732 VERSATILITY/MULTIPLAYER MIC-RECORDER\n",
            "733 It's a great deal, very good product for the money, but you need to be aware that your instrument (especially acoustics) will need to have the adjustable center arm raised considerably in order to keep the headstocks from bumping. The higher you raise it, the farther apart the headstocks will be BUT the higher you raise it the less backward tilt of the guitars. Less tilt, less stability, so be sure to use the attached neck holders. The attached photo shows two full size acoustics with the center arm about 80% raised and the headstocks are about an inch apart. Any lower and they touch.\n",
            "734 Amazon's product states that this shock mount fits 43 to 50mm diameter mics. It does not. It will not even fit my MXL V69XM which specs out at 47 mm diameter. See the photos ... it does not fit even with a white-knuckle effort to open the jaws. I ordered three through Amazon and none of them came in a Neewer box that was shown. Grossly under-size!\n",
            "735 Great Quality, adjustable tension. Well made.\n",
            "736 These go wonderfully with my Zakk Wylde Les Paul Custom Plus Grail. Been using Dunlop Straploks for years. They definitely take a beating. Granted I am not doing around the worlds and jumping around stage like a coke head, that behavior will destroy nearly any product, especially with wood and small screws. However, they definitely withstand some metal stage presence. Had some issues with seating but hats user error. Push the button and ensure it is fully seated and protect your guitar and investment. Easy day.\n",
            "737 Works perfectly for my ukuleles and guitars. Simple to use. Instant on and off. Perfect tuner!\n",
            "738 I bought a set of these to upgrade my Kona K1ETRD, a vast improvement over the old ones, now it stays in tune better and they're very smooth, looks nice too!\n",
            "739 This desk stand is small enough to easily fit inside my field bag, doesn't weigh much, and does its job effectively. Although it is small, it is still able to sturdily hold my RODE NTG2 microphone without danger of tipping over. Clipping the long microphone to the stand at the very end of the shotgun is a little precarious but I have made it work. It probably helps that the rode screw-on is very heavy, allowing the center of balance to be closer to the center of the stand.\n",
            "740 a little bit shorter than expected but pretty good\n",
            "741 Actually surprised. I originally intended to use this as a low gain type pedal but when I unintentionally cascades this into my Rat 2 pedal, a magical thing happened. This guy opened up the mids in the rat pedal. I am running the rat at 18volts with excellent results. This drive pedal is set at gain 2 and cascading into the rat pedal. Excellent! Immediately earning a prized spot on my board.\n",
            "742 I love the trashiness of this China! Hard to believe it's only a 12inch but it's sounds pretty powerful. I like it! Get one.\n",
            "743 Worked perfect for what I needed them for!!!!\n",
            "744 Doesn't conform to my Taylor 110 very well, causing lower strings to not push down enough and be muted or buzz. Tried readjusting 20 different ways to no luck. Been playing this guitar with capos for 12 years, never had a problem before.\n",
            "745 This is a basic pedal for vocal enhancements, but it lacks in the department of effects and customization. It would have been nice to have more effects and greater control over their parameters.\n",
            "746 Works perfectly with nylon flamenco and classical guitars. Use it in studio, on stage, never failed, great battery life, bright, sensitive.\n",
            "747 it's more on toy side than on instrument side, and made in Indonesia.\n",
            "748 Great little pedal. Wonderful brand. Well built equipment with quality. The housing feels solid and well manufactured. With sound in mind it has a fantastic beautiful depth to it. As a guitarist with roots in rock, grunge and metal it can be a versatile sound with the right mixture. Combined with a marshall tube dc40 and it will not leave you unhappy.\n",
            "749 This was a gift from my sister and brother in law for babysitting there kids until school start. I have to say this is an Amazing Guitar. For 200$ it's worth the buy and if your new to 7 string guitars you'll love it. Well shipped and a well made guitar. I couldn't be any more happier with the White looks so sick.\n",
            "750 For the price, this is awesome. The heel is larger than a standard Fender neck. If you're building the body, just make a template off the neck itself. The nut is cheap plastic. Buzz at high E 5th fret was fixed just by tapping lightly on the fret with a small hammer. Fret ends are sharp but not dangerous. Not too fat, nor thin. Truss rod turned free and easy.\n",
            "751 These are alot better than the Mahalo felt picks I've been using on my ukuleles. The Mahalos are soft, fat and flat, these are stiff, thinner and tapered, meaning they're easier to hold and play with and I get sharper sound. The 12 I got should last for quite some time, the Mahalos are showing more wear. Probably everyone should get some felt picks, very useful and alot of fun; these are really good ones.\n",
            "752 This braided cable is one of the nicest I've ever used that was under $50. The sound is crisp and not distorted with no buzz or ground hum, even jumping on the cable did not produce any undesired sound bleed. The ends are gold plated for increased connectivity and the ends are well shielded with a quality heat shield tubing covering the wire connections. the end covers are well threaded and do not loosen themselves after use. I have been playing for 15 years now both live and studio and haven't found cables this nice that did not have a hefty price tag. I plan to pick up a few more of these in different lengths to replace some others I've used i like them that much. I did receive this product at a discount in return for a fair unbiased opinion. If my review was helpful to you please click the yes button.\n",
            "753 As with other dean guitars this does not disappoint. Finish is perfect at least on mine. Grover tuners that stay in tune(my gibson sg's???).\n",

            "755 Let Me Start Of By Saying That This Is My First New Drum Set In 10 Years, And It Totally Rocks,It Is A Great Sounding Set! (Wouldn't Hurt To Upgrade Heads And Cymbals) But The Current Ones Will Hold Over, Until I Can Get Upgrades Other Than That I Am Very Happy With This Set It Is An Excellent Upgrade From My Old One And Comes Through 100% Best Purchase Made!

            "759 Very poor quality. Two of the pegs are missing part of or all insert. Back they go. Wouldn't waste your time or money on these.\n",
            "760 You can find cheaper power supply units, but they tend to add noise.  Thanks to Amazon's return policy, I was able to try out a couple units.  The MXR M238 unit worked great and is very quiet.  Pedals can be very picky and I had trouble with chaining some of the pedals together.  The MXR pedal was the best option for me, it had enough sockets and the size of the unit worked great for my board.\n",
            "761 I recently started using very light guage carbon strings (E1 is .024 inches) and E1 and B needed double knots (triple knots on E1)  to keep them tied and tuned.  Even then sometimes E1 would come loose.  A friend told me about string ties and suggested they might solve the problem. I looked around at the various tie systems available and I bought the Diamond Secure Classical Guitar String Ties because I liked the size. The result was what I needed; B and E1 don't slip with the ties and they stay in tune. I did a double loop with E1 as suggested in the instructions, just to be sure. I was concerned about the appearance of the Ties, but I am satisfied with the look. The Ties are small and have an unobtrusive,  neat appearance.  The attached picture shows my first effort with the Ties. In terms of sound or effect on the guitar I don't hear any difference, but the Ties do simplify the process of tying on strings.\n",
            "762 Excellent budget 7 string , Had to touch up the fret work a bit and tighten down some of the screws but other than that it was perfect . Replaced the original strings with 11-64 for A standard tuning . i wasn't sure if i was getting 22 or 24 frets on the guitar as it said both in the description but it did come with 24 frets . Have been playing Korn and trivium covers so far and its perfect for it . Stock ESP pups are not to bad , decent tone , i'm using a peavy 6505+ amp .\n",
            "763 Thus should be a 5 star review, but sadly, it's only a 3. I bought a cymbal off of eBay that was a mess. I got it for next to nothing and figured I would clean it up. Cleaner sure worked well and then THANKFULLY I read to not use on the Letters. Holy cow I was this close to cleaning up those areas when thankfully someone called me and I read the entire bottle to the very end.\n",
            "764 I got this for my Ibanez EW20ASE.... the pin on the back of the body by the neck was too far recessed to get the rigid plastic ratched clasp on it.... I was mad for about 10 seconds. Great quality strap, looks fantastic, feels great to the hand and the locks are nothing to sneeze at, they really lock to your pins. So, I took it and put it on my Ibanez AS93 (a fairly heavy guitar for being semi-hollow) and they fit, perfectly. I had just done a string change and spent a little over an hour playing and breaking the strings in, this strap is super comfy (especially for not being padded). The material is somewhere between satin and a seatbelt with a cool stitched \"xxx/diamond\" design (that's my words, not Planet Waves). Absolutely love it and VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND for use with any guitar that doesn't have recessed strap pins) A++++++\n",
            "765 Oh my word I am sold I love my AT2100 which Ive used for 5+ years for podcasting and YouTube BUT this thing is amazing for my current use case. Im using it as a boom above my head for YouTube videos. Wow! At about 2-3 feet away it is perfect. Very rich sound for my bassy voice. I recommend this to anyone who wants a budget mic with awesome sound.\n",
            "766 I've got a five person band for our Hawaiian performing arts group. These headsets make for even audio. No fading in and out as a singer moves closer or farther away from the mic, or turns her face to the right or left. They use the Shure SM58 pick-ups which are time proven. These headsets are especially good when I want to record a live performance. Anyone want to buy my stick mics and stands?\n",
            "767 I ordered this case to travel to Brazil with my 335. Fits perfectly as its not an actual Gibson 335 so I was a little worried at first however when it arrived and I placed the instrument inside I was very pleased!\n",
            "768 For what it is, it is great. Perfect for practice.  Past my days of playing live, now it is just for pleasure.  This amp delivers for that.  Keeps the noise down for others, delivers great sound, takes up almost zero space. Great buy.\n",
            "769 The Amazon advertised pictures of this item is a Fender FTE3 pre amp. The description says it's a Fishman Isys III type. I googled it and found out there's two version of pre amp type of this T Bucket 300 CE series. The one I got today is a Fishman type pre amp which is for me much better that FTE3. Out of the box, I fell inlove with the color and design. Mine is a 3 tone sunburst. The action is just right for me. The tone/sound is awesome. I hooked it up in my Vox amp and I have to say this thing really rocks. Of course you can get a better sounding acoustic/electric guitar out there for a very much expensive price. I'm a family man with two kids and I am not gonna spend a thousand bucks just for a hobby. Amplified or not I love the tone of this baby. For it's appearance, sound quality, and of course THE PRICE, I'm giving it a five stars.\n",
            "770 Awesome. Quite an upgrade for me after only owning cheapo guitar stands all my life. This baby is thick, sturdy, and very difficult to tip over. One thing that's not mentioned anywhere: these stands carry a LIFETIME WARRANTY.\n",
            "771 What I ordered was MSP6100 SP Lifespan 80/20. But what I got was a package of 7050SW with a sticker on the backside reading 6100\n",
            "772 Perfect RGB 86 LED PAR light! Very bright, light weight, sturdy! Fitting well in my music studio set up! I'm gonna order 3 more! (My favorite color is blue:)\n",
            "773 The bag is snug, but works well and has excellent padding for transportation.\n",
            "774 Blends beautifully with the chrome tonearm, and includes the 4g weight which is easily removed.  I am using in conjunction with an Ortofon 2M Red on a 1200Mk2.  Excellent results.  Somehow, although the output level is rated the same between my previous setup (Concorde cartridge with Ortofon Night Club stylus, 5mV spec), I am now getting a proper output level through my preamp, whereas the previous cartridge/stylus was at at least 6dB lower.  Weird.  Tried two different model stylii on the other headshell, another headshell altogether, and they both gave the same result.\n",
            "775 These fit my Schaller strap lock equipped straps perfectly.  Nice chrome coating.  The supplied screws looked a little thin, so I mounted the strap buttons with stainless steel #6 screws.  I'd buy these again for my next project.\n",
            "776 I purchased these stands to hold my Yamaha HS5's. These stands are really well made..heavy and have a nice look to them. I really like the triangle base as it makes it easy for them to fit in the corners of my room. They have locking pins that are great for keeping the stands at the height that you set. They also have some type of rubber feet that helps with leveling the stand. These are pretty impressive. The only thing that I don't like is that the platform that the speakers sit on are a bit larger than i'd like...but this is more my fault for not reading the dimensions. Other than that, I highly recommend these.\n",
            "777 It's built solidly but the tolerances and alignment of the various holes leave a lot to be desired, you have to be somewhat forceful in a few instances in order to get it to stay together straight. Once that was taken care of, there's really nothing to complain about, the unit is reasonably sturdy (don't jump on it, but it will hold your instruments no problem) and it's working very well for me. How well? Look at the picture!\n",
            "778 This is an excellent little stand.  The adjustment for angle is easy to do, and the construction is robust. Quite roadworthy!  It fits my Mesa-Boogie Subway Rocket perfectly, and holds it at just the right angle to make the most of my little amp.  The Boogie is no lightweight either. It is a handbuilt, all tube point-to-point American-Made amp in a robust case.\n",
            "779 This is a great Les Paul like guitar for the novice player. Very minimum setup was needed...6th string buzzed a little. Everyone loves the look. Fun to play at a very affordable price.\n",
            "780 I use this with the Zoom G3n and it works well as an expression pedal. Good value, solid build quality, so far so good.\n",
            "781 Well maybe not \"better\", different but on the same level of awesome sound. I almost want to lie and say they suck so nobody else gets them... The sound is so round and full I couldn't believe it. I started building my own guitars and I will buy more of those soon. Put three on my home-made strat,\n",
            "782 Perfect slide if you want more control over patterns and fingering as you play. The finger you use the slide on can bend and is free to do work as well! Plus the brass keeps it nice and chunky. Ive got small hands for a guy, I wear small to medium gloves, size 8-9 ring finger so based on the product  description I figured this would fit perfectly on my middle finger so I could do slide and chord mixtures. Wont go over my second knuckle on my middle finger which should be around a size 10-11. After trying tons of glass, chrome, and brass full slides, I found this small slide to be perfect for what I play.\n",
            "783 This is very best for me. Soft and safe.\n",
            "784 Well built, all metal construction, It's capable of holding 6 and possibly 7 smaller mics if you use the center mounting hole that goes over the mic stand, you can use a mic clip to hold the bar instead of the washer / nut. I use it to hold 4 large diaphragm condenser mics with shock mounts. It keeps me from having to swap mics for different vocalists when recording.  I just position the pop filter in front of the mic that is being used and mute the unused ones.  Sometimes I'll actually leave the other mics on and record the simultaneous vocal takes across several mics to separate tracks. This gives me several \"flavors\" to add effects to without having the vocalist do individual takes on different mics.  It saves a lot of time when choosing a mic for a particular vocalist.\n",

            "787 This was my first ever attempt to replace a nut and it was an easy job on my Epiphone LP Special P90. I filed down the ends a bit and used a dab of glue to help secure it.\n",
            "788 Looks great! Replaced the stock neck plate on my Squier standard telecaster.\n",
            "789 I like this pedal very much so far. My favorite pedal was a Joyo and it didn't last long. It's in my junk pile. I hate the for the money thing. This delay pedal does a lot more than most one trick ponys out there. Money when you get into Chinese stuff is a gamble, I hope I get some time out of this Joyo because it just that great.\n",
            "790 Great controller. The sound and build quality are very good. Balanced outputs, aux, 4 channels of control, huge responsive jog wheels. This controller also has VU meters for every single channel which is really hard to find at this price point. The low and high pass filters have a nice whisp to them. The only thing I don't like are the feel of the performance pads. They are not pads but more like triggers. Don't get me wrong, they work fine and are responsive but they do not feel like the pads that are on the pioneer ddj for example. They are not velocity pads. Other than that this thing is a beast and well worth the money.\n",
            "791 The price is to good to be true! It blew after light use of 2 years maybe 4 times a year! Started smoking all sound went out and ruined the event! Don't  waste  your money on something that will just blow after light use at very low volumes!\n",
            "792 I starting giving away my other stands after buying 4 of these 6 mos ago - lightweight yet sturdy, stylish and stable.  I'll be picking up 4 more soon.  Based on the build and style of these I also picked up a pair if ID speaker stands and sub poles, which are indestructible!  The Frameworks ID line has my vote!! Here's a few pics from the 2016  GABF festival in Denver...\n",
            "793 I ordered the RODE Podcaster and needed a shockmount that would work with it on the first try. I could have found a cheaper third party solution, but to be honest I wanted my Mic to have the products that were designed for it. That's why I went with the PSM1. It's got a perfect fit for the Podcaster and Procaster mic's. No real complaints from it thus far.\n",
            "794 I purchased this to protect my Jim Dandy guitar when I'm out and about.  It is a parlor sized guitar and needed a fairly snug fit - a regular dread bag was just WAY too big.\n",
            "795 Fits great but the only complaint I have is that the tremolo springs are cheap quality and so is the block that attaches to the bridge. I took it off and put my own on. When you do that though, the wammy bar won't fit.\n",
            "796 This tape worked great for my latest build. Adhesive is strong and the tape accepted solder well with no issues. It's thin enough to form inside cavities well and installation is easy. I would recommend peeling back just enough backing to start one end and then remove the rest as you go. Since the product comes in a pill bottle, it's formed in a tight circle so, if you just hold one end and remove all the backing, it will recoil and stick to itself. Great product!\n",
            "797 Overall, this neck is a good deal. It's straight, level and the wood has nice grain. Everything seems to intonate correctly. It fit my VM Squire Telecaster neck pocket perfectly. I had to file 7 frets to level it, but I guessed that going in.\n",
            "798 This pickup has a great, traditional, single coil strat sound. I'm really pleased with the sweet clear tone this delivers. You can make it scream with your amp setting if that's what you want. It's really great looking, too! I had no issues at all with the soldering connections, and the volume and tone pots work well as does the jack. I used this on a cigar box guitar build, and I love the tone! This homemade CBG sounds like a legitimate strat. I would definitely use this pickup again in the future, and I have no doubt it would sound good to swap out the pups on a cheapo commercial strat with these. My only complaint, and it's a small one, is that the knobs included had a tiny bit of smearing on the gold paint. It's not a big deal because many pups don't include knobs at all, and there are so many knob options available at very affordable prices. I actually used the knobs anyway, so I'm not going to knock a star off for that. The tone and looks of the pickup are fantastic at this price!\n",

Since I used the harp I am not going to return it but I'm not happy that I have to buy the harp again - the correct harp.  The harp they send me was a good harp but not what I wanted.\n",

            "809 These picks not only look good the are comfortable to use. The seem to have a rounded valley which leaves a raised edged. This helps to keep your finger on the pick and doesn't allow it to move around. In the close up picture you can see a slight curvature. This is the first time I have used these picks. I don't know how they will last but I will have fun finding out. It's a pick. You use it on a guitar. It's not complicated. I think its a very personal choice. But I have really enjoyed using these so far.\n",

            "811 I wasn't able to begin to get this item onto my Shure SM58 without tearing it.  Other reviewers have regarded the tight fit as a feature, but to me it it a big defect.  I take the windscreen on and off as conditions dictate, so I don't want to have a fight on my hands every time I need to make a change.  The picture shows a comparison of a Shure windscreen and this item (note the tear on the right one.\n",
            "812 I've been using this with my new Zoom H1n since I got it, and often times in very windy settings (the beach in particular). This works marvelously, as expected. The fit is perfect and the elastic has just the right about of grab. Other than it being quite large on my little recorder (my kids refer to it as my \"chinchilla\"), it works like a champ at muffling wind noise.\n",
            "813 I used to own a Boss CS-3. This pedal is almost as good for less than 1/2 the price and footprint.\n",
            "814 Good product, though in the 15 I bought there were slight inconsistencies in the angle lock mechanism. It seems the button latch is a little too low to click into place consistently on some of them, but it doesn't affect them in any real way unless you're the type who uses a protractor to angle your instruments just so. Also, if you have smaller headstocks on your guitars or basses, you'll probably need to adjust the width of the holder with channel-locks or something similar that can squeeze the sides together. Still, they look good, even better when mounted on a piece of stained pine, and they hold my guitars and basses nicely.\n",
            "815 Easier to install than I thought! Was a little skeptical because of some reviews... but I guess they were from people who can't follow instructions.... I used the little stick provided and was done in less than 10mins!  Love it!\n",
            "816 I can't see how you could get a better product for the money. This thing is fantastic. The size, man, Donner is really on to something with this Nano design. Around the height of a playing card and half the width. It's tiny but still fully functional for a basic delay/falloff pedal. The tone quality of my Chinese humbuckers through the pedal is great even if I put a distorted signal through it, and the range of adjustment is sure to add some flair to just about any playing style. Build quality is spot on, the plugs are solid, and the quality of the stomp switch would feel right at home on a $100 pedal.\n",
            "817 kinda flimsy but oit does the job\n",
            "818 This is a first blush review and might not be helpful to readers outside of the United States.  I have plugged a variety of pedals into the JP-02 and all powered-up as expected.  The AC plug that goes into the wall or power strip is not designed for standard outlets found in the United States.  While this is not an inherent flaw, it is not stated clearly enough in the item description and I do not believe it can be seen in the photos.  JOYO does include a 2-prong adapter for use in the United States.  The adapter is much smaller than the power supply itself, which leaves the bottom of the power supply resting 1-5/8\" away from the outlet (see attached photo).  There simply doesn't seem to be enough surface contact between the base of the power supply and the outlet.  A few trips over the power cord could easily compromise the integrity of the adapter, AC plug and/or your outlet.  I have not yet decided whether or not to keep this.\n",

I left the retainer clip in inserted the washer and nut to secure then tightened the plate and screwed in place. On my Fender l ended up removing the retainer clip put the washer in place and tightened and screwed the plate in place.\n",

            "826 So out of all the Tube Screamers I've had, this is the first to say \"Maxon\" on the outside. I have a TS9DX and TS9 that were made for Ibanez by Maxon in the 90's that were modded to 808 spec, and this pedal sounds dead-on to that sound.\n",
            "827 I was impressed by the quality and presentation of the packaging. It does mute my cello but it does not fit on my bridge properly. It won't go down all the way. It doesn't sound too great. I wish I had bought a rubber  mute instead.\n",
            "828 I got mine at a music store, not here, but wanted to give a review. First, it is a $40 uke... so people need to keep this in mind. I got it to play a campfires,  the beach, by my hot tub, etc. I am not expecting  it to sound like wood. Given that, I am very pleased. It is a great novelty item. People say theirs does not stay in tune, but mine does.  I can hang it on the wall and not touch it for several months. It  is still pretty much in tune, with some minor adjustment. But I would expect that from a wooden or more expensive one as well.  I added some miniature lights off Amazon and it certainly serves its purpose.  Enough light to see if I want to play in the dark, and also can be festive as well.  I have never regretted purchasing this.\n",
            "829 Stunned at how clear and full the audio was.  Very easy to use with my iPhone and a free audio recording app (Voice Record).  Then just push the result up to Dropbox.\n",

            "833 I like! I'm using the stomp thru a cheap reverb into a 15w bass amp. Going straight, not too impressive but, when ya lightly process the signal, it really pops! I used shelf liner to keep in from moving around when I play. Great for the price!\n",
            "834 Had to drill into my headstock. Needs 2 holes per tree because of the mounting peg. Use a ruler and a 1/16 drillbit and you'll be fine. I recommend installing with the strings on so you can set them properly.\n",
            "835 Not much to say here - they're knobs. They look good, are well made and fit perfectly on the CTS pots in my guitar.\n",
            "836 I have the 7 guitar version of this same stand (which costs less).  As I said in that review, put it together loosely, then, if all is good, tighten it down.  The instructions are OK, just make sure that you read them and identify all the parts (some look alike but are slightly different).  Poor reviews must be by the mechanically challenged.  You get what you pay for - even though the bigger stand costs less - but it works fine.  I have some very expensive instruments in mine with no worries.\n",

            "838 I have a newer model build without the coveted LM308 chip so I can't comment or compare it to that but in certain settings it does sound great.  I don't use this as a primary distortion but rather as one of many and I frequently use it in tandem with my DS-1 or Big Muff Pi. I use it to make already distorted sounds even louder and more dirty. The Filter knob should not even have the option of going all the way clockwise. To me, it sounds like piss if you do that.\n",
            "839 These stands are excellent. They are well built and easy to assemble. they come with an Allen wrench and that is the only tool needed. The stand has a nice design when it comes to the base. There are 3 soft rubber pads that come on the stand. They also give you 3 pointed metal spikes that you can put on, which is perfect if placing on a rug. The spikes are adjustable so you can get set for the rug height and get the stand perfectly level. I put a pair of JBL monitor speakers (LSR305) on this stand for my Yamaha piano DGX-650B. See attached pictures. The stands look like they were made to go with this piano.\n",
            "840 I just wanted to say that the Fender Vintage Noiseless Pickups were a great upgrade to my 2012 Fender Standard Stratocaster.  They provide a much cleaner, bell-like tone compared to the factory-fitted pickups.  The factory pickups are actually great for gritty blues and rock, but my playing is mostly clean, so I prefer the sound of the Vintage Noiseless.  Also, the package I got had the updated wiring diagram (correct!) - the only issue is that is didn't show how to connect the output jack hot wire, but it is shown on the wiring diagram from Fender's website (for the American Deluxe Stratocaster).  I installed the new pots, capacitors, resistor that came in the package and this gave me the cleanest, brightest tone.  If you want a warmer tone, you can probably skip doing this.\n",
            "841 I traded for a TMB100 in sea foam green recently and I was pleased with the construction. The wiring is good. After I set it up everything was great. My only complaint is that I had the bass only 24 hrs before the Tone/Bass knob snapped off in my hand, right at the base as I was adjusting the tone, rendering them useless and stuck in their current configuration. I didn't really think I was cranking it that hard. Now I have to buy a $60 preamp knob before my next show and be terrified that I'm gonna snap it off again. tldr: Great guitar. Needs a setup. Be careful with the specific expensive knobs.\n",
            "842 Cool little portable sound amplifier, for when you just got to make noise without waking the neighborhood! Very light, hope it's impact resistant so I can stuff it in a back pack with other goodies. I'm using it for harmonica, slide guitar, or as a powered speaker for my media players. The sound is decent and the battery seem to last long enough. I am happy with this purchase. Way to go Danelectro!\n",

            "846 Worked for maybe 30 minutes then it died and never came back on. Used standard pedal power supply to power it. What I heard sounded good, but its internals died so quickly. Tried batteries, and other power supplie afterwards. Nothing worked. Refunded and got a Dr. Scientist Pedal and have been amazed.\n",
            "847 Man. No words can not be said. I have a Catalina Maple drum set. Once I placed this head on there and that first hit. It sound like a cannon. Perfect sound. It make you want to play all day. Made me want to start dancing.\n",
            "848 This is my second ukulele. I recieved this as a Christmas gift and I love it. It has very nice strings and has like mother of pearl tuning pegs. With my first uke I had trouble with the strings being hard to tune but right when I got this I tuned within 30 seconds and started playing. Also it comes with a chord chart and songs and a case.\n",
            "849 Exactly what I needed! The wall mounts were extremely inexpensive, are nothing super fancy because I just needed something to hold my stuff to the wall, not to look super expensive and fancy, and work perfectly well. I have three guitars, two of which are in my little \"man cave\" so that I can just grab and play when I feel like it, and one of which is hanging out of reach of my four-year-old because it has sentimental value that she'll eventually learn to stop trying to touch.\n",
            "850 Made well. I'm pleasantly surprised of how pleasant the bells sound, very smooth. I'm using them on  top of my high hat for a little extra sound. I modified them slightly fir my purposes, but think they would be great as regular ankle bells as well.\n",
            "851 Quality is what I need! I was tempted to go with Behringer, but it originates in China, I have already experienced background noise and some power issues with previous versions do I said no. This has been fantastic on the other hand. Got this about over eight months ago, and so far it's been nothing but reliable and still can be used for quality audio. Also, Yamaha derives from Japan so wow, what a major difference. Thank you!\n",
            "852 I ordered eight of these after reading the reviews.  I have five guitars, including two Les Paul's and they hold them just fine.  I give them four stars.  The are fine for, I believe, all guitars at home, but I wouldn't use them for retail or something like a school.  They are made if ABS plastic and at the point where the arms swivel it's just a rivet the holds them together.  The wall anchors that they send with them are a joke.  like the other reviewer said, you really should find a stud to mount them to, but if you must use wall anchors, use the burly moly ones that bore into the dry wall.  All in all these are sturdy and stable (when anchored to a stud) and I'll use more if I have the need.\n",
            "853 This bridge cover is beautiful. It really adds flare and character to your bass. I personally added it to a Squier Bronco bass that I've modded with Mustang parts.\n",
            "854 seems like a very nice case, but quality control is questionable.  Case was damaged from the factory, no damage to the packaging or plastic bag surrounding the case, indicating the damage occured from the factory.  For the amount that I paid for this case I would expect a product in perfect condition.\n",
            "855 You just can't beat these Hohner blues harmonicas in terms of what you get for the money. Very good sound and playablity, durable, and not too expensive but the price does keep going up. I have 7 of them, some go back years and years (I like Lee Oskar harps too, but I prefer the blues harp as it's \"throatier\"). I see some reviewers have complained that it's hard on the lips or is not very durable; don't know where they're comin' from, no problems for me here (I have a bunch of Hohner Pro harps and they do hurt your lips; as for durabilty: only my oldest blues harp, the A, has a reed out, mainly because I played it for years like a 3 lung madman, the others are in perfect condition). If you want a diatonic harmonica that sounds better than this be prepared to cough up in excess of $100, otherwise get this.\n",
            "856 Great item for studio recording this improve my mix. Fast shipping great products\n",
            "857 I went from fender chrome non-locking to fender gold locking. It made my guitar look beautiful and play beautiful. I think locking tuners are the way to go. If you are new to locking tuners look on YouTube for instructions.\n",

The case that these two came in is very durable. The microphones and clips are securely padded within the case, which makes transporting them a breeze . We tested these out and they worked perfectly fine through the PA. The microphones sounded very clean, but on the bass(ier?) side, which can be adjusted if desired. Overall, this is a great buy! It is really awesome that these come as a set and with a nice hard case! In action, they work really well and 100% could be used in a professional setting. Thanks, Audio 2000s!\n",

            "861 A big improvement over stock pickups on my 1960 Reissue Stratocaster. Lots of high end snap, much less noise, decent balance between pick ups, classic look. Easy to install but does require soldering. The instructions (really just a wiring diagram) could be a bit clearer so be sure and make note of the existing wiring before you des older and remove the old pickups.\n",
            "862 i was expecting extreme brutality but got a pleasant surprise. this pup is super clean no. 1 and distortion is very smooth not at all what expected its warm in tone but has some bite to it. overall i really like this pup. to be honest I was expecting this pickup to be really mid focused but it has a tight punch in the low and the highs are not over bearing either. great pickup would get again!\n",
            "863 I really love the fretwraps, they're really usefull, specially when you need to record something and want a really clean sound, or when you are a bass player that loves the slapping technique.

Ive been setting them up on top of my powered speakers and angle them to hit part of ceilings and tops of walls. They are bright so by mounting them like this prevents squinters on the dance floor and you can see the patterns with out the use of a fog machine. They are housed in plastic and are very light. Kids love them and offer a a Big Bang for just a few bucks\n",

            "869 Well I got my guitar a day after it was supposed to be delivered by ups, apparently they called all the drivers back at 7pm. So I got it the next day and it arrived with a broken neck it probably was broken by ups, I feel if they would of delivered it that night then they wouldn't have to unload/load it so much,more chance of it breaking. So I got a replacement and this one is almost perfect but for the volume knob on the guitar makes static when you turn it up or down. Now I knowvthat is a common problem generally on older volume pots but this is a brand new guitar. I'm hoping that it will get better with repeated turning.it still is an awesome deal with the amp and other stuff its a pretty sweet sounding guitar especially for what you pay for it.\n",

            "872 I'll admit that I bought this power supply to see if I could save about $100 on a better known brand so I wasn't expecting it to work that well and figured it was almost as cheap as my OneSpot. I've got about 9-10 pedals on my board so I made sure ahead of time that there would be no special needs.\n",
            "873 I was recommended this particular harmonica by a few players who said \"Buy the Special 20. Its a great Harmonica and it's perfect for a beginner \" so I took their advice and I must say it's Fantastic. Looks and sounds great and I'm s total newbie but I'm having no trouble at all playing single note songs and exercises. I'll most likely purchase one in every key once I'm more confident and skilled with this one\n",

            "876 When I bought my Roland Gaia, I needed another stand, as I already have two keyboards on a double tiered stand, and I think 3 is too much.  The least expensive stand available at \"that other store\" was over $30, so I figured I get something used, or local.  Checking Amazon, I saw this stand, which at the time of my order was $20.00 even.  It seemed like a great value, so I ordered it.  The packaging was a little flimsy, but the stand arrived in one piece and in good condition.  It fit my Gaia perfectly.  The included straps don't work with the Gaia, but the stand holds the keyboard well, and at the right height.  It's a little beefier than stands in that price range, though not as beefy as my 2 tier stand, though that was much more expensive.  This is totally a five star stand at the price I paid, and even at $5.00 more at the time of this review.  For an inexpensive stand, I don't think anyone can do better.  Recommended.\n",

That guy was 100% correct! I just popped out the existing mounting ring with a flat blade and my V67G slipped right in and could be tighly secured using the black mounting ring supplied with the V67G.\n",

            "884 Worked Great in my kit build.  Had to enlarge the holes a tiny bit as they are ever so slightly larger then the stock that came with the kit.  They still stand a tad proud of the bridge but they do hold the strings well and it makes them easier to remove.  They look fantastic, great buy for the money.\n",

            "889 I needed something to put a karaoke monitor on out front of my DJ setup and on a whim went looking around for a VESA mount for a mic stand. Found one, but also found this, which is 10 times better! This stand is GREAT! It is heavier duty than my speaker stands and the legs when fully opened will stabilize the biggest  monitor you reasonable would put on a VESA mount that size. The small 17\" one I have on it solid. It is hard to tell in the photo but the mic holders do have a slot on the side so wired as well as wireless mikes can slip in, you'll want to use a round head Shure 58 or equivalent so it doesn't fall through. Like others have said the hardware is top notch, adjustments can be tightened down securely, and the monitor and its adapter can be taken off with just 2 thumb screws for transport. Great deal at the 70 price too!\n",
            "890 The arm is extremely short and should be longer\n",
            "891 This one is much more stable than the brand they have at my music studio.  I like this one way better.  The platform is wider and my foot seems much happier.  Yes, it costs more, but it was worth it for me.  Very happy with the purchase.  And it lays flat for easy storage.\n",
            "892 Small but powerful enough. It is well made, pretty basic for a speaker.  I would probably buy another one.\n",
            "893 I gave a cheaper neck a shot. I am blown away by the look of this neck. The stain used is just enough to highlight the grain nicely and the clear coat is darn near perfect. I figured a lot of time would be during the \"adjustment\" phase of the build. Nothing else had to be done once the neck was set and bolted on. What a pleasant surprise since in past builds I'd spent an hour or more getting them set. I've used Fender and Warmoth before that cost 3 times and more than this one. The proof had been in the pudding though. This neck has been on this guitar for over a year now. No problems. I use this guitar as a back up and play it quite frequently on gigs. I buy more!\n",
            "894 This is a fantastic rack and makes my home studio look really professional.\n",

            "896 Awesome stand. Best one I've ever had. It's not that heavy easy to carry in maneuver. The push adjustment for the up-and-down is great quick and easy holds really good. Feels like it's going to last a long time without being overly heavy. I really have no complaints thing works great. I did put a counterweight cuz my tube recording mic is kind of heavy.. wish I could buy 20 for 50 bucks. Wish they had a deal for multiple...\n",
            "897 I was surprised of the quality of this mic. I used it for recording sessions and sounded clean. I would definitely recommend to anyone to purchase this product. I did not use the unbalanced cable it came with because I had balanced cables that were better to use.\n",
            "898 Nice guitar.\n",
            "899 I just tested this fog fluid with a 1byone 400W fogger. Two 30 second bursts were sufficient to create enough fog layers for a moody atmosphere in a 2 car garage. This being a hot space I was pleasantly surprised by how long the fog would linger. It would quickly rise to eye level and then just hang there. Another nice surprise was the odor- there is not much of it, but if you step in the middle of a thick pocket it smells like lavender (?) soap.\n",
            "900 Unfortunately I received plastic pins with black dots. Not happy and have to return them.\n",
            "901 Cable quality is great, as usual from monoprice. However, Monoprice used a very sticky tape that left a huge amount of tape-glue on the cable rather than two twist ties or similar..Went through 10 minutes and 3 clorox wipes getting it all (mostly) off. Unusual for them.\n",
            "902 Just got my pedal board yesterday!  I love it.  Before I had my pedals strewn all over the floor.  Now they're organized and easier to use.  The board is larger than I expected b/c I didn't pay attention to the measurements in the description.  But I'm glad I chose this one.  It gives me an excuse to purchase more pedals.  Obviously the stock photo shows many pedals placed really close together which is not realistic considering the cables that are involved.  I'm attaching photos of my board for better reference.  Eventually, as I add more pedals I will place the power supply under the board, but for now I like the blue illumination of the AGP power supply.\n",
            "903 This was supposed to be red tortoise.  It's actually closer to brown tortoise.  Maybe in between red and brown but certainly not what I consider red tortoise. I actually have another guitar in need of a brown tortoise cover so I'm using it on that one so not that big a deal, however will not work on my intended red tortoise guitar.  I've attached pic of the this cover which is on the guitar on the left.  The one on the right is what I consider a proper red tortoise.\n",
            "904 Overall I'm happy with the stand.  I admit I was scratching my head a bit when I was putting it together.  There's more pieces to this stand than others I've had.  Adjusting it is a little bit of a pain because there are 4 different areas that you can loosen and change around.  If you travel and gig a lot, you may want to go with the higher model, the adjustments look a bit easier.  However once all setup, it's sturdy and well built.\n",
            "905 Great price and good quality.  It didn't quite match the radius of my sound hole but it was close enough.\n",
            "906 I have a garage sale piece of junk MIJ hollowbody that I've used Amazon to build for cheap.  It's been a blast and this fit the bill perfectly.\n",
            "907 A great product if you need to connect a guitar to a computer or other USB compatible recording device. The cord is incredibly well made. I would say this is for home-use or hobby recording. It would be wonderful to be used to save song ideas or songs in the making. The connections work just fine and are well made. The cord is nice and long so it's comfortable to sit or stand and play and not feel too attached to a computer. The connection points are nice and sturdy so they won't break. If you are in the market for one of these types of guitar cables, I do recommend this one.\n",
            "908 So i needed a cheap guiar that i could bang into walls and not care, so i got this thinking it would be perfect for the job. Sadly, i fell in love with it even though they sent me the wrong guitar. (Amazon falsely advertised it). I got the brown sunburst (absolutely beautiful) but instead of a white puckguard, i got brown sparkly one. Oh well $10 and 30 minutes later and i can fix that. Anyway. It sounds great for a $125 and plays amazingly.\n",
            "909 I put these in a new bass I built last week.\n",
            "910 Outstanding case!  My H6 fits into this case perfectly.  It is made of heavy duty plastic, which is at least twice as thick at the case that comes with the H6.  Each cut-out within the foam interior is custom sized to fit your H6 and all of the accessories.  The latches are very sturdy.  See picture to get a sense of the size in relation to the standard H6 case.  BUY IT...\n",
            "911 These really tidy up my practice board. I like the little donner pedals and these chain them nicely. I do Velcro them down so at some point Ill have to deal with taking stuff apart but.... oh well.\n",
            "912 Absolutely awesome cables for the money. I've bought a number of these in different colors. The connectors are really decent and the cables are very well made- nice silicone jacket.  I've shortened a number of these LyxPro cables using the original ends for balanced line use in a patch bay.and also using, Neutrix TRS connectors, Neutric XLR's, Switchcraft right angle TRS ends, and even some ends of off some Seismic Audio cables.\n",
            "913 I have worked in radio for over 12 years as well as voiceover.  My main microphone has been the big brother to this one.  Most radio studios you enter use the RE20.  That being said when I recieved this RE 320 I was blown away.  I have done my radio show with it exclusively for the past 8 months and love it!  This mic ROCKS!  This microphone has XLR connections so be sure to use good mixer with those standard connections for a top quality mic like this.  When you first get this microphone you immediately notice the professional look and feel to it.  It is all that you would imagine it to be. Simply put this mic is top quality and produces great sound even without processing.  5 STARS!\n",
            "914 Light is bright, light weight, and small in size. Works great in auto mode and sound activated mode. This light almost goes 360 degrees, and will easily fill a backyard or small hall.\n",
            "915 The Ditto is the best looper I've owned (I've tried a few). It's very easy to use.\n",
            "916 Cool little box, I'm using it with my Arturia Microbrute analog synth, looks cool, sound good, easy to use, fits well in gig bag.\n",
            "917 Installed these humbuckers on my Epiphone Les Paul Standard. The sound of the neck and bridge humbuckers are very similar. The bridge just has a tad bit more treble. However, both of these HBs produce a very, very warm sound. When playing with an MXR Distortion + it produces a grunge/fuzz sound but keeps clarity of each note. The clarity is outstanding on the HBs-each note can be heard. The HBs are not very versatile, only producing a grunge/fuzz sound, regardless of what distortion pedal I use but it fits my playing style at the moment so I am very happy with them.\n",
            "918 If you're looking for a gig bag for a semi-hollow guitar or bass, this will do the job. Make sure you are looking for part number 0991622206 - that's the Metro Gig Bag for Semi Hollow basses.\n",
            "919 This case is awesome!  The molded interior fits my Fender Jazz Bass like a glove and I feel it's secured at all times.  This is the second case I've owned and the quality is superb!  It balances much better in my hand while carrying it than my last case which was a bit front heavy.  It's also lighter in weight than my previous case too.  The open compartment is deep enough to fit my cable, strap, tuner, accessories and I usually throw my amp power cable in there too.  I also like that the open compartment does not have a door that you always have to open or close.  Just open the case and everything is there for easy access.  Lastly, cosmetically this case is very sweet looking.  The black, white and chrome details are perfect and of course the chrome Fender logo on the top of the case really sets it off.\n",
            "920 These sticker pentagrams are real nice. Have some left over and put them on my violin. Badass.\n",
            "921 I installed this kit in my Squier by Fender Vintage Modified Stratocaster. What a great upgrade. The guitar comes with all those tiny pots and cheap electronics. Get yourself one of these kits if your guitar came with cheap electronics. It is a Tone Buster... :) PS I added a few other mods myself.\n",
            "922 I wanted gold jacks, not silver. I've built a Steeler-themed guitar (see photo) and these silver jacks are wrong. Will you exchange it for the gold jacks?\n",
            "923 Works as advertised (I'm sure along with the other 5 or 6 brands out there that are the exact same one- see pic it's the one they shipped). Only thing I'd say is pay attention to your current- everything worked fine except my wireless (line 6). It'd power up but then go dark. Turns out it was plugged into a 100ma port. It needs upwards of 300+ma. Plugged into the correct port and it was fine. So far no issues after about 6 or 7 gigs. I'm surprised because it's priced so cheap. Comes with all the barrel (power) cords (Not the 1/4\" cords). Can't go wrong for under $40.\n",
            "924 I have a 1986 Peavey Patriot made in the usa guitar. It had one cheap string tree that wasn't a roller. These work great! Make sure to drill the holes for any of these trees you are going to install. The included screw cannot handle the pressure of screwing it in. I will add pictures soon. You won't be disappointed. They add incredible sustain to my guitar!\n",
            "925 First of all, I am a HUGE Fender fan. Guitars, amps and especially their pickups.  Second, when it comes to tone, I am very picky. I love the Fender Custom Shop 69s, 54s, 57/62s and Fat 50s. I wanted to try something other than Fender this time, so I chose these SSL-1s. So far I think they are absolutely the best single coil pickup I have ever had. Big, full tone with bell-like highs and a clear bottom end.  On a lot of pickups in Strats the neck pickup can sound too quacky, too much twang and it over powers everything else.  These strike a very nice balance with quack and all the other harmonics that are present.  Some other vintage single coils Ive tried have too much chimey-ness in the tone, too much high, drowns out the mids, again these SSL-1s don't do that, even though there is still tons of chimey, bell-like tones, like glass breaking, very brilliant, but its balanced out with the mid and low tones as well.  Very nice and yes I would buy them again.\n",
            "926 At the Price point and what it deliveres it's a must buy. I play Bass. Only a few things I can gripe about and it's the clarity of the notes not being as clear and the split with the music (aux) and headphones..gotta find the right spot. That said it's built great for plastc...very sturdy..and the fact I can USE AAA batteries and not LITHIUM BUILT IN is what sold me over others too! (Buy your own batteries)  Comes with cheap batteries. The device works so well I can change two batteries but if the built in stop working and it fades away.. device is no good. Nobody knows I'm evening practicing or jamming. Very nice should have baught along time ago. I use Beats headphones and Uiisii Us90 ear buds sold on Amazon..the best earbuds you will find!($10!) Find them!  Why the Beats? I use the cord for aux to phone. But u can get an aux cord ..(preference)\n",
            "927 Fits my Squier Stratocaster (Bullet) great, with a few inches to spare lengthwise.  Theres a ton of great zipper pockets, the handles are great and the padding is pretty decent. I use this for light traveling for my cheaper guitars. In my opinion I would not put an expensive guitar in here as the padding isn't the best, but it will still resist scratches and small bangs but more than likely not drops.\n",
            "928 5 stars. For its price and size, couldn't have asked for more.\n",
            "929 Love it! I have had other tuners & recently bought a pedal tuner. I like this because it's much more convenient. The pedal wears through 9 volt batteries pretty quick, so I'm constantly plugging & unplugging. W/ this one, I just move it from one headstock to another & turn it on/off as desired...\n",
            "930 I have a Martin guitar and Martin strings are the only ones I use.\n",
            "931 This stand is perfect.  For the price, it's hard to see why anyone would settle for cheaper.  The stand is stable and locks the guitar to the stand at the head stock. The locking mechanism senses weight and locks the guitar in place without extraneous adjustments.\n",
            "932 Ordered a \"MUGIG\" tuner, but received one with a \"Musedo\" brand mark. (See photo) Who is \"Musedo\", anyway?! I'm sure I'm correct in my assumption that these inexpensive tuners are mass-produced in China and receive all manner of brand name logos on them.\n",
            "933 This is now the second pop filter I have purchased of this brand, and there has been one significant upgrade that I am jealous that my previous purchase of item didn't have. I have been setting up two separate recording PC's at home, and my son wanted a similar setup as I had. The first filter I had purchased still works and I liked its ease of use. I was pleasantly surprised to see the one thing I disliked about mine had been changed.\n",
            "934 I like these things. Bought 12 of them and Never had a problem. They come with drywall mounts as well as stud screws.  I always put into studs. Mutch safer than lots of stands that can fall over. Great price and solid.\n",
            "935 These were perfect in every way for my application.  I installed these on a MIM stratocaster (I had to drill three holes in the tremolo plate to do so) and they were the correct NARROW string width ( 2 - 1/16\" ) for my application.  I was even able to top-load the strings through the holes where the intonation screws originally fed through, just to piss off the purists.  It worked so well that I am doing the same modification to another of my import strats, but this time with graph tech saddles.  Those ones will work as well, but I have to sand off some injection mold flaws first (although that will be easy as well).  I'm a believer in either brass or graphite when it comes to the break-angles of strings and these were literally perfect.\n",
            "936 First of all these lights look great! The flashing patterns and bright lights really add pazaz to a party or get together as long as the lights are dimmed of course. The LX-5 has a built-in microphone which is used to match up the light flashes to the beat of a song playing, and this works very well as long as your speakers have a subwoofer (built in or external). I listened to some dubstep tracks while using this and I couldn't believe how accurate it was! The lights alternated between each color during the climb, and flashed in a unison strobe at the drop!\n",
            "937 I'm writing several different reviews here on Amazon to inform all of the shoppers that ALL of the low priced scissor arm mic stands on Amazon right now are the exact same model, just branded with the different logo. I actually picked up the \"neewer\" brand one because it said it came with an integrated XLR cable and a shock mount, but it did NOT, even when I exchanged it for another. Even the box said it has those accessories, but none were included.\n",
            "938 The fender modern player stratocaster is a great guitar, I bought this guitar and modified it with chrome pickup covers and chrome knobs, it is a great looking and great sounding, I strongly recommend this guitar.\n",
            "939 Absolutely amazing! I think they are direct knock-off of Seymour Duncan SH-2 Jazz Model Humbucker Pickups. (you can see the same little holes on each of pups) Powerful, bright sound, no noise. My old Johnson LP with ex \"EMG-ish\"  pickups are now fully awake and angry in a good way. Great quality! Thanks everyone for good review.\n",
            "940 Thickest and most durable beater patch on the market. Buy this even if you don't use Aquarian heads. It'll prolong the life of any head!\n",
            "941 I recently got a used, but excellent, Epiphone Junior.  I've been playing for over fifty years and owned many -- many quite fine, costly, guitars. But as others have discovered, these older, P90-equipped Epis belie their cost. They play and sound GREAT.  With one exception: They come with pretty poor tuners.\n",
            "942 I have both Teles and Strats, and they both rite in this case perfectly. The extra storage areas are great, and you don't get outside storage pockets on a hard case.  The case is very well made, durable, and light.  I think the price for this product is a very good value. I know this will suit my needs perfectly!\n",
            "943 These are not bad for the price and have a good feel to them weight wise. I would say beginner sticks for sure but once you get to be a better drummer and you are learning how to make different sounds with your kit like a rim shot. These will snap off fast. It didn't take too long for my son to snap the tip off doing a rim/head hit. if these are for a electric kit, I would give these a 5 star for that perpose\n",
            "944 These are too thin to be effective on their own.  I love these for their color and overall aesthetics.\n",
            "945 This is great. I bought for another reason but used it instead on my hihat and removed the legs which it is meant to do. Its more solid than with legs and less clutter. Now I have to buy another for the original purpose. I love it.\n",
            "946 I've been using this little amp for over a month now and totally love it.  I run it into a small cabinet with a Jensen Vintage C8R4 8-inch ceramic speaker housed in a maple 12\" x 12\" cabinet and it sounds amazing.  If you closed your eyes you would think you were hearing a Fender Tweed combo from the 50's.  I use a delay/reverb combo pedal in the effects loop insert and it's as sweet as the larger setups I have in my main music room.  I use this in my office and it's perfect for the space.  I can't believe such vintage tones can come out of a chip-amp that is as small as a stomp pedal.  If you're looking for extremely high gain, try one of the other Hotone amps like the Legacy British Invasion or Purple Wind.\n",
            "947 Monster grips are a necessity for guitarists and bassists who demand that their pick has a grippy surface! They adhesive on them is very strong and will stick to picksp made of any material. I use them on carbon fiber picks, bone picks, brass pics & horn picks.  I've discovered that they are also handy for other things as well such as pictures and frames on my wall. One monster grip on the back corners of the picture frame will keep them from sliding crooked on the wall!\n",
            "948 It works! This is a nice product I'm happy, however there are some things I noticed but nothing to take much away from the pedal, especially considering the low price.\n",
            "949 Great little set. Practice pads with options!\n",

The mic isn't the best I have ever seen but for the price range it sure is good. I was skeptical but the XLR did come in handy. And it is heaps better than any built in microphone for any other webcam, laptop etc. The headphones are excellent, far better than any other headphones you'll get for fifty bucks.\n",
            "951 Judging from the reviews, the quality must be variable, but this one was a quick bolt-on. The neck was straight and even had the correct relief; frets were smooth and will require only minimum hand rolling of the ends. This one had the correct strat heel shape.  It is a beautiful fretboard with lots of character; the inexpensive nut was the right height and easy enough to replace.  I was able to brand it with my logo, give it a few coats of tung oil and put it on a handmade custom ordered offset guitar that I just finished in my workshop. I've ordered another.\n",
            "952 Nice heavy duty drawer.\n",
            "953 Love it. Thick plastic. Good quality ez install.\n",
            "954 Better than or equal to the higher priced competition. I've used the competition product and prefer this one. Plus the remote comes free, can't beat that.\n",
            "955 I was invited to play quasi-Dixieland banjo for a quasi-Dixieland musical (\"The Boy Friend\").  They told me my banjo wasn't loud enough though I thought it was plenty loud. I didn't want to mess with a mike since the sound guys never get that right.  Or with running a DI into the sound board for the same reason.  So I ordered this pickup from Amazon and installed it.  I ran it through a small Crate combo amp (XT65R); it was plenty loud - in fact I'll be cutting it back tonight.  Sound was OK, would probably be better through an \"acoustic amp,\" but it's good enough for the musical.\n",
            "956 Looking at these on a guitar when they don't have a single wrap on the post, I found it hard to believe the strings would even stay on but I have now installed two sets of these on two different guitars. One black set and the other is gold. The first guitar would not stay in tune so I tried these. They have been on for nearly a year now and they totally fixed my tuning problem. The second set I put on my brand new Gibson Les Paul only because the first ones worked so well. Super easy fast string changes with the auto trim feature, and no tuning issues at all. At 18:1 gear ratio they dial in a perfect tune and hold it. I prefer these over Grover or any other higher priced tuners available.\n",
            "957 Superb built quality and sound. Seriously you pay for the Moog name but damn is it built solid.\n",
            "958 I was hoping that these weren't cheap quality-wise, and they're not. They are perfect. Fits awesomely on my Shure SM58 and Peavey PV mics.\n",
            "959 Upgrading from a Numark Mixtrack Pro to this is night and day.  While I didn't buy it off amazon, I've attached my picture of the set up.  Definitely... buy a high quality flight case.  You don't want to haul a $1000 masterpiece and haul this in something that doesn't protect your investment.\n",
            "960 My oldest son and husband are avid guitar players. We have close to 20 guitars in our home both acoustic and electric. Since my son began playing guitar he has gone through at least 6 Capo's. It had become a joke in our family whenever we drove past Guitar Center we would ask our son if he needed a new Capo.\n",
            "961 Really nice product if you don't have a whole lot of money. It sounds a little mid-range e . Other than that it's a nice product.\n",
            "962 These went on my new Strat a day after my white Strat came home. The only reason is for you! Changing strings in no time. Do they do anything else, nope.\n",
            "963 I put this on a Yamaha drum rack. The tubes are rather large and this thing opened just wide enough to clamp on. I was really surprised. When I first opened the packed I was thinking I'd have to send it back, but it works perfectly and the clamp is very secure. I submitted a picture of it installed. It doesn't look like it's on all the way, but this thing hasn't moved in almost a year!! I would highly recommend this product!!\n",
            "964 Truthfully, I had no idea that the even were ukulele capos. But why not? I use them on guitars and banjo, and there are certainly times when you might want to shift key without transposing so you can take advantage of open strings.\n",
            "965 Cheap and effective. You'll need to print your own decals, but it's MUCH less expensive than the 70 bucks some other fool was trying to get out of us. They look great! Fits my Shure mics nice and snug. Will need to play with the SM57 a bit - not much room left to grab the mic with a foam screen. But we'll work through that.\n",
            "966 This happened (check out my picture) in about 3 to 6 months of use. I guess you by cheap, you get cheap results.\n",
            "967 This pop filter works perfect and I like that it's easily adjustable. The images show a all black pop filter but I received a white and pink/purple filter. That's the only reason I'm going to give it 3 starts. Isn't a little strange and everyone always comments on that fact. It kind of throws off the vibe of my booth. I'll be purchasing anyone some time in the future from a different company most likely because I want a black one. Image attached.\n",
            "968 Odyssey 8-Space Rack is great. I put casters on mine to move it around when I need to.\n",
            "969 Sound is clear and crisp, bowl is beautiful and a good weight.  Love the little pillow.  I have not mastered rotation the striker yet, but I am working on it.  It's a great singing bowl. You won't regret your purchase.\n",
            "970 They were right about filling a large room up with fog. I am a DJ and my light show has never looked so awesome. I would gladly give this product a thumbs up for sure. I have found that the best place to set this up is on the floor. The fog raises slowly. Do not set up on your light stand the smoke goes right at the dances. I am learning.....\n",
            "971 Soft material, and good open sound, I play now with mouthpiece #c5 and its like 2,5 on standard mouthpieces\n",
            "972 Awesome display, and covers a large area. Simple menu and many auto/sound activated programs to choose from(with and without strobe). Strap this to a 4Bar or GigBar IRC and add a small fog machine. Ordering another!\n",
            "973 I ordered this for my daughter as a back up. we finally opened it to get it ready and started tightening , the end part broke!\n",
            "974 I though this was gonna be three green packs separate, but came in one green pack. It has all 3 sets but the sets inside are separate in clear plastic for each. The strings themselves are very good. I love these for electric guitar.\n",
            "975 Works with a Heil PR 40 after taking off the bottom cap. In doing this you need to utilize the piece that comes with your PR40 and secure your mic by screwing it to the bottom of your mic after putting it into the shock mount. Would of liked a natural fit without doing this but for the price it can't be beat and works very well.\n",
            "976 I diid an \"All Fender, All Over\" (as much as practical) upgrade to a $190 GFS Xaviere \"Tele\".  It came exceptionally well packaged an absolutely no flaws. Unlike the cover that came with the guitar, this one is non magnetic, which is a good thing. The GFS guitar is mostly vintage specs and this cover fit perfectly. Makes me wonder if some of the other reviewers got knock offs. I always buy original manufacturer stuff when doing a hardware upgrade, especially if it's only a few bucks more. I've had my fill of trying to fit crappy, cheap, import stuff. Don't get me wrong, there is some really good import stuff out there, but you really have to know what to look for and do your homework.\n",
            "977 Work well for a very reasonable price. Arms are padded well, so no damage to the neck or head.\n",
            "978 I love behringer products cheap and reliable...not my favorite distortion but good for the money..\n",
            "979 For the price, it can't be beat. I hadn't picked up a fiddle in 50 years, so I didn't want to invest a lot of money in something I wouldn't use, but I was pleasantly surprised by this instrument. Of course it's not a high dollar violin, but there is nothing wrong with it.\n",
            "980 I own 3 of these Minis.  Quality on this one is the worst. Glue joints at the neck/body were messy. Had a couple of small dings (see photo of one under strings near bridge) but the important stuff is OK ( neck is straight and the bridge is sound). Fret edges are very smooth. Sounds great but not as good as the Ovangkol.\n",
            "981 Okay, the idea is good, but the materials used are inferior. What good is a locking mechanism if the cheap plastic breaks off? The plastic part that the nylon strap is looped through broke clean off, right on stage. Luckily it was right at the end of a song as I played the last chord, and I held onto the guitar so it didn't go crashing down on the stage. But it could have, I was just lucky. Where the strap loops onto the plastic mechanism is the weak link. The locking part is a good idea. Not going to trust this thing with my instruments though. I had an old Ernie Ball spare strap in my case with simple leather ends. I will use it from now on.\n",
            "982 This guitar is far more beautiful in person. The red to gold tones blend so wonderfully and it has a barely visible tiger-stripe/wood pattern effect that I hadn't noticed prior to purchasing it. I got it here for a fraction of the price I was finding it other places. I have had no problems with it whatsoever yet, it plays easily and sounds like I spent a lot more on it than I did. It even arrived sooner than was expected.\n",
            "983 Great cup holder. Very sturdy, easy to clamp on a Pearl cymbal stand, hasn't moved through 50+ hours of rehearsal and performances.\n",
            "984 Fits 8 Chauvet Slimpar 64 RGBA, power cords, DMX board and paperwork in front pouch and misc. supplies in end pouches and nothing is tight. This bag is made very well and has heavy duty zippers. It has 10 dividers that Velcro in and can be moved. The bottom velcros in too for nice padding. At first the bag seemed short inside so I removed the bottom and placed it in properly to get the right height. It also has a nice shoulder strap. Finally a great product. I am now a Phitz fan!\n",
            "985 I purchased this kit to have an organized and efficient way of changing my guitar strings (electric and acoustic). I like that the tools are all organized in one pouch, there are slots for string set(s), so that you never have to worry about being unprepared for a guitar emergency (hence the name \"gig\" mate).\n",
            "986 the anouncement says original fender, but i recieved a emerson pot inside a simple plastic bag, and without the tonecapacitor .... I don't like it.  :( :( :(\n",
            "987 As a \"Starter\"\" guitar or as a legit back-up it's hard to beat the LP-100 for the price.  I was a complete newb when I bought this model 5 months ago - took it to a friend who's been playing for 30 years and he was really impressed with everything about it.  As a result of having such a good time learning on this one I upgraded 3 weeks ago to an Epiphone Les Paul Standard Red Royale Model.  I got the LP-100 back out last night for the heck of it and am Still impressed with it. Had thought about selling it when I got the new Epi LP but I think now I will hold on to it awhile!!  I purchased Black with cream colored trim then swapped out some of the trim for black and blue\n",
            "988 They were perfect! Man i love them....\n",
            "989 When I first pulled this out of the box I was pleasantly surprised. There were quite a few negative reviews, so I was half expecting  it to arrive in pieces. But it was packaged well and already assembled, so I was pretty happy. Once I had it installed on my rack, I noticed the cable holes in the back aren't even punched out! The main reason I bought this was to store my noisy external hard drive.  I can't do that now, so I guess this drawer is just going to hold random crap that I have on my desk.  I'm honestly pretty bummed. I was tempted to give this two stars, but the drawer itself is pretty acceptable for the price. If you don't need to run cables through the back of it,  then I don't see any reason this wouldn't work for you.\n",
            "990 Its a pick holder. It does what its supposed to. I mainly use Fender medium picks, and have a few Fender heavy picks around. I don't have any thin picks. Itll hold 6 heavy picks or 9 medium picks. I would imagine it would hold 11 or 12 thin picks.\n",
            "991 I took me some time to get set right, now I really like it.\n",
            "992 I use this with an&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/On-Stage-MY550-Microphone-Extension-Attachment-Bar/dp/B0002ZO3LK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">On Stage MY550 Microphone Extension Attachment Bar</a>&nbsp;to mount the mics that come in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Nady-DMK-5-Drum-Mic-Package/dp/B0002GXUMW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Nady DMK-5 Drum Mic Package</a>.

            "993 Works great !!!\n",
            "994 No Gimmit, I am NOVICE and the Vox is great!!!!,..\n",
            "995 Input jack is crap broke first time I plugged it up. This is probably because it was damaged when received. The knobs where also scratched when received. Luckily I had a spare input jack.\n",
            "996 Awesome thumb pic!\n",
            "997 I find this unit adequate, I use it with my MacBook as part of a portable 'winter' studio. I also own a Scarlet 2i2 (Gen 1)  which I use in my primary studio  I find the 2i2 has superior sound quality  less audible distortion / lower noise  and I prefer the 2i2's Neutrik style XLR/TRS output connector. The Behringer is a good value  it works fine and has good features / performance for the price  but like other Behringer products I've used, the sound quality / noise / distortion, leave me wanting a better product. If features or budget are at the top of your list, this product should do the job; if however sound quality is of primary importance then I'd recommend the Scarlet 2i2 (look for sales or a used Gen 1).\n",
            "998 I love how this baby sounds! It has a nice full loud sound. Tones are just right! Its better looking than the pictures they give you. I no its an Epiphone but I would play this guitar anywhere! I have several guitars but I can't set this baby down! I have Grover locking gold tuners that will go right on!\n",
            "999 Love the blue glow of the power supply on my pedal board.  I've only had it for a day so I don't know how it will hold up, but i'm sure it will be fine.  Comes with all of the cables to fully power your pedal board.  The A/C adapter cable is only 3 feet long so consider buying an extension chord or power strip to plug it into.\n"

            "3 This guitar is perfect in every way! It's so easy to play and sounds fantastic! Perfectly balanced with zero neck dive. The bomb inlays just look cool! I definitely plan on buying more Hardluck Kings guitars!\n",
            "4 Beautiful, well-made strap. Matches my guitar nicely. Perfect.\n",
            "5 Amazing and highly different Wah from ibanez,This is the WAH YA WANT!!,too many reasons!,Just check it out!!!\n",
            "6 The quality is excellent\n",
            "7 Good quality :)  perfect for my office/studio setup!\n",
            "8 Works nicely on my guitar thanks.\n",
            "9 I have purchased 7 Donner guitar pedals recently  and I like the price of these pedals as well as the sounds quality of them. On several pedals the true bypass switch is loose and on another  pedal the same switch is slightly stiff. Due to the small size of these pedal, I was able to put 11 pedals total on a 12in12in plant caddy after removing the wheels.\n",
            "10 Thank you\n",
            "11 These pedals are great!! A friend of mine said I should buy other pedals because these pedals aren't manufactured by a very known brand name but I went with my own judgement and I was not disappointed with them. I have increased my speed a lot since I've gotten em and I can pedal songs like \"All Nightmare Long\" and \"Beast and the Harlot\" now  =]  great pedals. BUT, it takes time to develop speed so don't think the pedals suck just because you barely get em and you can't go all Jason Costa on em\n",
            "12 The X1 MkII is an essential part of my setup (Decks, Effects, Browsing etc.) You can midi map it to other DJ software (This is an update to a previous 2 star review) I know now how to use most of it's features.\n",
            "13 I like these microphpone windscreens and the price can't be beat. I have a few lavalier microphones and wanted to use them for recording outdoors. Unfortunately they are larger than what I would consider a lav mic windscreen. I have found they work best with my olympus me51s lav mic and they significantly reduced wind/ambient noise outside. The colors are nice and help in location them and not misplacing them. I have lost so many small black lav wind screens that if I had a dime...well you know the rest. I included a picture in the customer gallery so you can see beyond the stock photo what you're buying. I would recommend and just mention again, be aware of the size you're getting.\n",
            "14 The last drummer who played the USA Ludwig kit I my studio used a set of the black paint Vic Firth Steve Gadd signature stick and left black paint marks all over my white coated drum heads as black paint flecks all over. Luckily I already knew that a tiny bit Magic Eraser removes things like that from those drum heads.\n",
            "15 These stands are balanced, sturdy and lightweight. The locking strap is a nice feature but not even necessary. Not sure how some people are placing their guitars, but unless they have a defecting unit, it's pretty impossible to mess up. I use one for my Gibson Grabber bass and the other for my Taylor 114e acoustic. Works great for both!\n",
            "16 I have tried several violin strings and these are the ones I will buy again and again. Over all great even tone. Not to bright but clear.\n",
            "17 I've used this on a dozen flights and it's nice and hard, great for protecting my bow.\n",
            "18 I have been using these DR flatwound bass strings with a great deal of amazement.  I have installed these strings on two of my basses and I find them to be most excellent for my needs.  For one thing, these kind of strings are not \"fret eaters\" due to their flatwound smooth surface.  Also, they are lots easier on your fingers if you should play that way.  The various tones and behaviors that these strings produce is hard to describe, but it is a situation that very much agrees with me.  You almost have to hear them to really know.  I just got done installing a set of these DR's on a Reverend Thundergun 4 string bass and they sound awesome.  It might be noted that this bass has a 34\" scale neck and string through bridge.  I had no problems with installation or in tuning.  I am pretty much committed to these style of bass strings.  However a word of caution here.  These strings are not supposed to fit long scaled necks.  I shall conclude this review with 6 pictures.  5 stars on these strings for dang sure :)\n",
            "19 This strap is well made and is very comfortable. I installed Dunlop Straploks, which was a chore because the leather is so thick, but I got them on without cutting or modifying the strap. The leather is soft and the padding is nice. I bought another brand of leather strap that claimed it was padded but it wasn't. This strap is nice and cushiony. Highly recommended!\n",
            "20 It's great for my Taylor 150e 12-string guitar.... My only issue is that the wand it came with had a tear in the microfiber duster.\n",
            "21 Works so good that I didn't expect it to. The connected is not locked into any one position which means it's always turning so that can be a bit annoying. But once set, this small device delivers better than my amp. Was thinking of getting for a friend. I may just do so since it is this good\n",
            "22 My use for a guitar stand is primarily so my guitar actually gets played instead of sitting in it's case.  I love this stand!  It is stable and the pitch on it isn't so great for my Martin DC-15E that it takes up a lot of space.  I like that it doesn't have the higher piece that sits on the neck so it doubles as a decorative piece.  I couldn't be happier!\n",
            "23 So far I really love this tuner. Nice, large Brite screen, it's fully chromatic and your able to change the Hz for non standard tunings, like A 432, which I have actually tune songs recorded in. One issue, don't forget to turn it off as apparently if you don't, it will not shut down on its own due to inactivity and will drain the battery to zero.\n",
            "24 LOVE LOVE LOVE this controller. I use it with the free Serato software for professional gigs. Only downside is the microphone input which does not have much control. It was hard to get the right balance without feedback. I easily fixed this by using my amp input and external mixing board to control the mic levels.\n",
            "25 I have been using Fender locking tuners for about five years on various strats and teles. Definitely helps with tuning stability and way faster to restring if there is a break.\n",

The Xvive Sweet Leo O2 Distortion pedal is a great budget lead lead pedal. Im super impressed with the build quality and packaging from Xvive as well as the tones. If you are looking for a good lead distortion pedal that functions like how a tube amp works, you may want to consider this pedal. In this video I test it out on my Stratocaster (Partscaster) with humbucker pickups.\n",
            "27 It's hard to give less than 5 stars because this light is just an amazing value. It packs a serious punch in terms of output and feels quite sturdy. It has a very thin profile and the housing is a thick rugged plastic. Mounting hardware feels smooth and easy to adjust. The display on the back is larger than other lights of this style which is nice when configuring DMX channels. I control mine via a software DMX system, so I can't speak for the built-in modes. It has worked flawlessly in a DMX environment.\n",
            "28 I got these because I hate changing strings on a floating tremolo any more than I absolutely have to.... at first I thought I may have made a mistake because the tone was all off (super bright sounding on first installation).... played for a half hour and retuned, sounded better. Played for another half hour and retuned, sounded even better. Played for another few hours and they sound fantastic. Will update after I get a hundred hours on them (about 50 days from now). Will say that they handle bends very well and dive bombing deep on the trem hasn't hurt them yet.... VERY IMPRESSED\n",
            "29 The first one of these I used, did not work at all. After troubleshooting, I solder out the tone control and switched it for the volume pot that seemed to be shorted out perhaps from too much heat from the ground soldering on the back from the factory. Everything worked but there was still hum that I eliminated by running it through an effects pedal. The second one worked but had overwhelming static and hum, but it was cheap. I wired bypassing the controls, plugged it into a separate volume pedal and into an amp. It works fine now but with a little hum. I may still use these in the future because they are very inexpensive. I would use a better and more expensive pickups on better quality guitars. In the future, for one of my inexpensive projects, I would probably just order the pickup without the wiring harness and controls. But, rethinking, even buying an output jack and a bit of shielded cable at Radio Shack would have been more expensive in the end. You can't beat the price.\n",
            "30 Great idea, but unfortunately the clamp doesnt work correctly. You can only adjust it with the tab in the closed position, as opposed to the position shown in the instructions, defeating the easy on/off feature. Also the bracket that attaches the clamp to the cup holder uses a single screw, which loosened up while I was trying to attach the clamp to a mic stand. I was able to tighten it up, but I needed to remove the bracket in order to do so. Further, even after tightening this screw, the bracket still had a tendency to swivel.\n",
            "31 They're pretty perfect for my violins, but I have to readjust them often\n",
            "32 This is a great little gadget. Being a lead Guitarist I,m always look for a new sound. This little reverb works great working with all My other pedals. I highly recommend this one to all My other Guitarist friends out there. ~Pepper~ Austin Texas\n",
            "33 Works well! And the free guitar picks don't hurt. Looks nicer than a standard silver/black capo, and functions just as well. Have used it for a few weeks now with no problems.\n",
            "34 Easy to fit to my violins top with a good sharp knife and some patience, need to get some better sand paper to make it a perfect fit. Please note this is not a bridge you can unpack and simply insert you must fit the feet to your violins top. Really enjoy the curve of the strings as well. All in all a great step up from the factory fit bridge that came on my instrument.\n",
            "35 I'd give it 5-stars if it was filled-in around the connector (cleaner look and easier to hit in the dark).  Otherwise it was a great solution to cleanly put  an access port on the front of my portable recording rig.  I have lots of USB-A to USB-B cables about, so that connected me to a standard USB audio interface inside the rack also with a B connector.  I already had another B-to-A adapter like this for a USB charging jack that is reversed, with the A-B cable on the inside going to a standard USB charger.\n",
            "36 My husband got Guitar Hero for Christmas and on a whim added one of these hangers to his wish list.  One of our friends got it for us, almost as a joke-- but then we mounted it and realized how handy it was!  It works wonderfully for our little plastic guitar, saves it from getting scratched up in the closet, and looks pretty darn cool.  Highly recommended!\n",
            "37 For the price, these claves sound amazing.  I wanted a natural wood tone as an alternative to the piercing, higher pitch of my fiberglass LP King claves.  These did the trick.  Amazing value.\n",
            "38 Great replacement. 3 ply and made very well. As good as the Fender parts. NOTE: This is for the made in Mexico (MIM) or Fender American Standard Stratocaster. Please read all the specs on the website description. See a lot of people complaining it doesn't fit their Strat. Well it's because it wasn't made for their model. This will NOT fit a Squier or Roadhouse, Deluxe. Do your homework and you won't land up with the wrong pickguard.\n",
            "39 Agreed not for the Bonham wanna-B's.\n",
            "40 purchased a very used studio les paul...ruff shape buddies came together and super cleaned it..changed the knobs..glad i did these did the job just fine..will use again\n",
            "41 look great on my les paul\n",
            "42 a little higher up than I thought it would be, but nice that I got my pedal board running a little under my amp, now i don't kick my amp when i go to switch effects.  Wish there was more adjustability but it is what it is, one of the more affordable stands can't be asking too much.  The back power plug socket on my amp (Bugera v5) barely interferes with the back bar of the stand (bottom of the plug hitting top of the bar) but I got the weight of the amp slightly resting on it and I don't think it's severe enough that it's a danger.  Stand won't be moved around much so  I expect it to last for a long long time.\n",
            "43 This is a great option for creating a lively, party-like atmosphere. It lights up with many different colors and can be used for many different environments. Its very portable and I like that there is very little set-up involved.\n",
            "44 These strings are wonderful. My go to strings have been the Gibson Bill Monroe, however amazon does not stock those currently. So I decided to give these a try because they are the same gauge and phosphorus bronze just like the Gibson. These sound just as good if not better than the Gibson BM strings. They are warm, bright and very projecting. They have that signature bluegrass sound that you hear on the classics. I love these strings!\n",
            "45 I like this pedal cause it's similar to Mesa sound...Love JOYO\n",
            "46 Best strap lock system out there! -\n",
            "47 For the price of tunable bongos you get 3 roto-toms and a stand.  An inexpensive way to expand your current drum set.\n",
            "48 I think that this is a great product (because it is for a complete keyboard), but I do have one tiny, tiny problem... They are so tiny that I can't see them.  I looked at many vendors for this type of product and because yours ran the full gambit, I chose it.  If you have any that are larger and has all 88 keys, I'll trade with you!\n",
            "49 I bought this to fit into an Ibanez Edge Tremolo. It was a little different to figure out, but once you get it fine tuned and set up right it worked absolutely perfectly. My trem was blocked so I didn't have to worry about it interfering with the recessed route.\n",
            "50 this uke sounds so good! it is my favorite out of all my other expensive ones! i can't believe i got it for 40.00$!!\n",
            "51 Took a little while to arrive, but it's good quality!...put this on a subRay 4 bass pick guard fits but the hole don't line up 100%, but that doesn't bother me\n",
            "52 If you want some fun or you are having a down day (and who doesn't some times)...just get this! It is so much fun. Turn on your favorite music and turn this on by simply plugging it on a wall outlet and watch the light show - just fantastic, if you like bright colorful lights. The colors vary and change depending on the sounds from your own music. These are LEDs so very little electricity is used. You can place this table top or hang it on a wall.\n",
            "53 I was pleasantly surprised with this Hankey ukulele. It looks beautiful the neck is great the sound is great acoustic and electrically with amp or pa. Well worth the money worth the money. I'm very happy with my investment. I highly recommend this awesome Ukulele. ;)\n",
            "54 My ES*335 fit loose and needed some padding added to keep the guitar snug, but if you don't mind doing that it's a good deal...\n",
            "55 Just what I needed, although at it's lowest setting, wass about an inch too tall for me sitting on the edge of my bed. Ive gotten used to it now so it's all good! Like others have said, it's good quality and sturdy construction. I stubbed my toe on it in The night, and quickly wished that hadn't happened! The rubber grip on top is actually riveted on, so that should last a good while. I also used this for when I practice standing up. I rest my foot on it which pushes the bottom of my guitars out so I can see what I'm doing. All in all its a good product and I recommend it. A word of warning, this is made of strong metal, if you're buying this for your son or daughter, show them the dangers of the scissoring action of the legs. I imagine they could do some hurtin to little fingers.\n",
            "56 This pedalboard is the best value entry level board ive seen on amazon.... Very well made, sits on floor with a good angle, very useful slats and spacing to make cables tidy underneath so you can organise the pedals in a non linear fashion  .  Its big enough to grow into. Love the lightweight aluminum. Velcro straps come with it to strap on your mini power supply (donner psu no less lol).  I also hid my noise suppressor underneath since thats an always-on pedal.  This way, you get even more pedal space on top. I fit all my pedals and probably room for one or two mini pedals or one more regular sized pedal.\n",
            "57 Adding some twang to my Jim Dandy campfire guitar.\n",
            "58 The flute came in good shape, but there are two holes in the under side bottom, toward the end, with both holes connecting to one another at a 45 degree angle.  There's no way to cover these holes and play the flute.  I'm guessing it's a manufacturing mistake, where someone got a little too happy with the hole drilling!!\n",
            "59 It's bigger than I expected and when you pull it out of the box it comes in it has this square shape. LOL. I like it and will hold on to the box just for that. Fits perfectly easy on off. The black area is rubber. I thought it would be foam. Pretty good at wind protection. No popping. It looks good with the H4N Pro. A few loose hairs and sheds a little bit but hopefully all the loose ones with be gone after a little while.\n",
            "60 I would give this 2.5 stars. The reason they disappointed me somewhat is that the squares have a degree of variability to them. See my picture. Some are taller than others, some are more grey others more black. And even after sitting a few days there were still dents in them. They worked but after buying 96 of these I wanted more uniformity.\n",
            "61 This added the je ne sais quoi to my PA sound.\n",
            "62 Fantastic case I got for a great price.  Thank you Amazon for saving me $70 on this one item as compared to Musician's Friend or Sweetwater.  I had several guitars I could use this with but it fit the one I was hoping it would a Schecter OMEN-8.\n",
            "63 Quite possibly the nicest guitar straps on the market.\n",
            "64 I installed these myself using the Elenco Electronics ST-12 Soldering Tool Kit on a 2012 Fender American Stratocaster. I didn't like the Custom Shop Fat 50's that were installed. I wanted something that could growl, that was noiseless but still kept the chime of the king tone and these pickups deliver. I adjusted them a couple of times (not too high) and may have found the sweet spot. I don't change pickups too often but the fat 50's sounded too farty and muffled to my ears. I also like to play a wide range of styles ranging from Jeff Beck jazz to Yngwie Neoclassical to John Mayer blues. These pickups are able to handle those styles easily. Most importantly they are dead silent and that's important when you're doing a lot of recording.\n",
            "65 With a much needed modification, this became a far more durable board.\n",
            "66 Guys, this is a really good sounding pedal.  It has enough highs-lows-mids to make you smile.  The sound is similar to pedals costing much more.  Of course, everything is based on taste and the kind of music you play.  This is not a super scooped metal pedal.  It's best for strong overdrives and smooth grudge sounds.  The big factor about this pedal compared to more expensive pedals is that it doesn't like HEAT.  I had a gig in Detroit on a metal stage with a 100 degree PLUS day.  The pedal didn't like it at all.  My BOSS Blues driver was just fine.  Of course the Blues Driver is a $100 pedal. It took the temps just fine. So, that is, in my opinion, the big difference between what you get with JOYO vs other, more expensive, pedals.  Keep in mind, if you are not playing in 100 degree temperatures you have nothing to fear. So, rock on and enjoy your music!!\n",
            "67 Just upgraded to this board and I am very happy I did. I needed more stereo inputs and this one had 4 of them. When it comes to an internet radio station you need a clean quiet board. I have no noise coming out of this board so I am very pleased. Plus I needed the AUX outs for my TelosONE set up. Everything is working perfect!\n",
            "68 I do wish some reviewers would do a little basic research into what they are buying before posting negative comments. This neck plate is a high quality replacement for the plate that comes standard on newly-manufactured US Strats (and probably Teles). I purchased this to update the look of my '97 \"weird, fat logo\" neck plate and am very pleased with the results. The material appears to be aluminum or aluminum alloy with a chrome finish, in contrast to the heavier steel that it replaced. I did not bust out the calipers but it is at least as thick as the older version. It is not plastic, nor pot metal. It comes with screws. For giggles, I stopped by Guitar Center after installing it and yep...all American Standard Strats have this exact same neck plate.\n",
            "69 This strap is advertised for a mandolin, but I put it on my ukulele. I found guitar straps (usually 2 inches wide) and even dedicated ukulele straps (usually 1.5 inches wide) to be too bulky and uncomfortable. This strap is only 3/8\" inch wide, but my ukulele is so lightweight that I really don't need anything wider and a narrower strap doesn't get in the way of my arms and hands. Installing this strap without removing my ukulele strings took some effort. I had to unthread the strap loop (which is really much tighter than it needs to be), then thread the strap end under my ukulele strings, then thread it back through the strap loop (which is still much tighter than it needs to be). The plastic buckle in the middle of the strap is not removable, so you need to thread that through strap loop and it is a real tight fit. Once installed, the strap works great. The thin soft-ish cotton is more comfortable on my shoulder than thick leather or stiff nylon strap and it doesn't seem to scratch my ukulele wood at all.\n",
            "70 If you're looking for an inexpensive party light, this is a great option.  The beams are pretty tight and is really set off with a fog machine.  The speaker inside was shocking at first (when you plug it in there is a commanding voice talking about bluetooth connectivity.)  There is a little wireless remote that is useful within 10 feet or so.  The motor is a bit loud but with music playing you won't notice.\n",
            "71 I Purchased this unit primarily for sweetening up a violin pickup and an acoustic guitar with an LR Baggs pickup. I'm highly impressed with the improvement in the acoustic guitars tone and character. The parametric equalizer is fantastic for dialing in perfect tone. The unit is dead quiet, the only noise noted was when I tightened up the bandwidth and boosted level into the upper 3rd of its range on the parametric eq. In microphone applications the unit performs equally well and the low cut worked great for reduction of handling noise. This is a fantastic tool at a bargain price. I own an ART tube MP preamp also and this unit is definitely a solid step up from the MP. Thanks to Behringer for making great quality affordable products for musicians on a budget. The only knock I can come up with at this point is that the manual is extremely basic and if you're a new user of mic pre's you're kind of on your own. It would be nice if they had included some application recommendations for basic settings,\n",
            "72 I previously purchased the 20' cable for my SG and Marshall amp, and I was very satisfied. I have a couple of pedals with different variations that I wanted to incorporate, and the old saying \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\" came to mind. So I ordered 2 of the 6' cables to complete my personal set up. You can't go wrong with these. Great Cords!\n",
            "73 Love this stuff so far. Looks awesome and I can definitely hear the difference acoustically. Hoping I don't run into the blue / green issue that other reviewers have seen.\n",
            "74 Love the beefy strings.  Depending on the style of music you play, you might want to give the heavier strings a spin around the block.  If you're on full-tilt distortion all the time, you probably won't see a difference, but if you play without a lot of pedals and like that slightly crunchy breakup to come from your amp, the Beefy strings can make a big difference.\n",
            "75 Another update. How can you sell these to people! I have a craft show this weekend and i went to put these tumers on and none id the screws fit! First one i didn't realize and it got stuck. I had to use two pliers to pull it off and scratched mlthe new neck i just finished making. Your company shpuld not be selling these! I now hqve to run out and find somewhere to but 6 sets ....Update....i ordered more, they came in odd. The top is too wide that the nuts don't fit!\n",
            "76 As I said elsewhere, the pick wears on the edges, and breaks very quickly, within hours if you play hard. I use it on an acoustic guitar with Medium to Light strings, so really! After at least 3 years, I am still using my Dunlop medium guitar pick. The rubber part also \"hangs\" on the low E string, especially if you are trying to hit it for the first beat of the measure or simply for emphasis. This is probably a bad habit, which I could unlearn, but only if the pick would last longer!\n",
            "77 Works great as a guitar bench mat. Not rugged enough for abuse but if you take care of it, it will take care of you. Makes organization of workspace much easier because screws won't roll around. Color is good too.\n",
            "78 I ordered these for my Road Worn Player Tele,  They fit perfectly. no more winding strings and my tuning problems have been resolved!!!!!!!!!!\n",
            "79 Everything met my expectations the product was good quality, easy to install even without directions included and my guitars look great hanging on the wall. I read negative reviews saying that the quality was crap and it took them an hr to get it threaded onto the base. Unless you have no basic knowledge of being handy this will not be a problem just make sure you find a stud on the wall and screw the included screws through the drywall and securely into the stud. Before you do this  run the  screw that attaches to the base through the threads to avoid any issues like the negative reviewer had. After you attach the base to the wall thread in the guitar hanger screw firmly and you are good to go. I personally would easily buy one of these for the price of 2 they are great quality for the price and if you have more than one guitar to hang then this product is a must buy!!!!\n",
            "80 I purchased two of these to hang guitars in my music room. These are well made and certainly do the job okay. However, I completely did NOT trust the two skimpy screws they provided to hang this unit. They are basically drywall screws, but these have a rather skinny diameter. I was not about to trust my vintage P-Bass to a skinny screw inside a hollow-wall fastener. No, I used a heavier \"construction screw\" directly into a wall stud. See photo. I was seriously concerned that the supplied skinny screw would actually break off in the stud. If you are hanging a lightweight acoustic, then the supplied hardware should be fine. I'm probably just being paranoid and overly cautious.  Other than that, I like it (tho walnut piece could be a little bigger in my opinion).\n",
            "81 Great, lightweight product that easily replaces some of my older lighting that's nearly eight times the size and weight.  Having two synced with a DMX cable easily fills the room.  The extra colors not available in many of the big name lights is great addition (orange, purple and white).  Only time will tell how reliable they are.  I'm not a big fan of the white house (which glows), but aside from that, they're perfect.\n",
            "82 Bag itself seems to be nice enough, certainly the stand fits. The strap failed me and broke upon first use, not even with heavy weight in it. The carabiner slipped out of the socket thing. I don't know how to explain it, all I know is I had to replace the strap altogether.\n",
            "83 I bought this bcos it was cheap. The fastener is difficult to unclip due to its tiny size. I have small hands. I like it better if the strings are shorter, so it won't dangle. So far it serves me well\n",
            "84 This is nominally a violin/viola stand, but due to the length and neck diameter, also works well as a mandolin stand. My Paris Swing mandolin fits nicely into the Auto Grip holder. An added bonus is that my Irish bodhran (18\" frame drum) rests comfortably on top of the Auto Grip assembly, with the bottom of the rim resting against the padded legs as does the body of a stringed instrument.\n",
            "85 This thing kicks some serious butt. An excellent, deep, thumping subwoofer. It really rounds out our sound. The first day I got it I ended up with a sheriff in my front yard asking me to turn it down. :)\n",
            "86 Perfect fit on my Epiphone LP 100.... My beginner guitar.  Had to decide if I wanted to sell my LP-100 after upgrading to an LP Standard.  Decided to keep LP 100 for sentimental reasons but wanted to get rid of Cream colored trim.  Swapped out cream colored pick-up trim and the poker chip for Black ....love it\n",
            "87 I manage a classic rock band. I recently ordered a bunch of stuff to replace aging gear. Cables, mics, stands, snakes, etc. We have now been out on a couple of gigs with the stuff. It is all good quality and working fine. Does exactly what I expected it to do. No surprises. In the interest of time I am applying this exact same review to all of the items I bought for this purpose and am happy with. FWIW, I am also taking the time to be critical of the items I am not completely happy with.\n",
            "88 this pedal is for marshall amps it with a e.q. and compressor made a awsome metal skull ripping tone I was thinking of a voodo mod but a friend told me about the pedal and man its got more than enough gain  i mean lots of distortion it and eq compressor makes for a great combo  so get rid of all the tube screamers and go to the turbo rat if you got a marshall\n",
            "89 Competitors had detailed drawings and better pictures causing me to worry I'd made a mistake with these. Luckily, when I tried to cancel, I was too late. These dandies hold the pickguard firmly and even better-the correct countersink, satiny color & flatish profile make them nearly disappear into the pickguard. PERFECTION!\n",
            "90 There is not any noise during use, and not heating with 8 pedals powered on running for 5 hours, the voltage of each channel keeps the same. Stable power supplying. With 7 X 9V 100mA +1 X 9V 500mA+1 X 12V 100mA+1 X 18V 100mA can work for at least 10 pedals easily. 10X50 cm cables are long enough to reach any part of the pedal board. Small size, and will not taking up too much pace. The Polarity Reversal Cable can help you cope with different pedals. Stable output and cost-effective. Provides 10 power outputs, it is able to work for a standard pedalboard. But the price is not so expensive as the Voodoo Lab or T-Rex, etc, you can easily have a power supply to work for your own pedals. I am quite satisfied with the price and stability overall it is very worth having. NO HUM! EXCELLENT POWER! GET ONE!\n",
            "91 For the money this pedal is great but you really need to use a noise gate with it, the background hiss is almost unbearable when when activated and not playing.\n",
            "92 I didn't realize they were so short, but they still worked perfectly.\n",
            "93 Bought it as a gift for my brother, but got to play around with it for a couple of days. Sounds great, doesn't go out of tune too much, but I read that is normal in new instruments so no worries there.\n",
            "94 Tiny little amp. I have never seen these in my retail shops. I just ordered from here. After putting in a 9V battery and plugged in my Gretsch guitar, instantly I heard the punching sound of rockabilly. Never did I ever heard any strange sounds of feedback or popping or screeching. It was quiet and perfect for me even when I played it real close to the amp. I did not purchase the DC adaptor, just relying on batteries. Imagine I could play electric guitar in my car, how portable is this thing! The bad thing about this is that the box packaging looks cheap and printing was bad. The brand name of the amp is located at its back, kind of shy of telling others it's Fender. At first I suspected it was fake. However the sound doesn't lie. I realized this amp cost more than the others, not sure if other brands are equally good as well.\n",
            "95 This happened (check out my picture) in about 3 to 6 months of use. I guess you by cheap, you get cheap results.\n",
            "96 No the best sound but for practice along without disturbing the neiborhoods is the cheap and best option...\n",
            "97 I LOVE this thing. It works as a VOLUME pedal, WAH pedal and EXPRESSION pedal, all in one. Also, the WAH sounds amazing. The small size of the top plate makes it a breeze to use and pull off all kinds of things that are much more difficult with a full size wah.  In short, it's built like a tank, sounds amazing and looks great :)\n",
            "98 Don't care what anyone says, these things are great. I've completely upgraded my lighting with just two of these. Nice and bright, easy to setup master and slave and very durable if treated with care and properly stored/transported.\n",
            "99 This would be my fourth Ocarina Wind ocarina. It is by far my FAVORITE. I love the \"Sound of Earth\" design. The mouthpiece is perfectly sized. The body design is very comfortable and feels natural to hold. The rough finish makes it feel sturdy and adds some nice grip! The slight indent at the subholes makes it very easy and comfortable to use them. (My trumpet creeper ocarina's subholes are a pain, and the \"rythym of the earth\" are a little close, I am always hitting them on accident!) It is also the most in tune, all notes! It has a great, mellow but resonating sound. I would love to see more aesthetics with this body design! I truly was surprised. I have 3 other ocarinas from them that are more than reasonably priced for decent product, but this one in particular blew my expectations out of the water! I definitely recommend this for any level, especially beginner at this price. It is worth much more than what it is being sold for! I actually bought another!\n",
            "100 All I have to do is install this on my Strat. Instructions gave me a good idea of what needs to be done, and I have experience with all kinds of stuff since I was involved with all types of Proto-Typing in many different machine shops so it should be a fun project.\n",
            "101 I play guitar with a flat pick. But I also play ukulele, and hard picks can make the uke sound a little harsh. I've tried felt uke picks, but they never felt comfortable. So I use one of these Alaska Pik Fingerpicks over my index finger for strumming. Size is important. I have medium sized hands, and these picks can slip off my fingertip when it's hot and muggy, like when I'm playing at an outdoor market. That can cause some awkwardness when trying to strum, sing and keep the pick from flying off my finger. I might try the next size smaller in the future. But this is the best pick I've found for getting a loud, round sound out of my uke.\n",
            "102 I absolutely love these!! I bought these colorful wind screens for my karaoke microphones. I have received many compliments from family and friends!! Definitely worth the price. It took a little while to get here, but worth it!! I noticed other reviews stating they didn't get the same colors as pictured. I received the right colors!\n",
            "103 I have always hated tuners; I would rather use tuning fork on the A string and go from there. Most tuners are too cumbersome and require large batteries or external power(pedals). In addition I couldn't use those on my acoustics. Snark solves all of these problems. The display is colorful and easy to read and hides neatly behind the headstock. There is also a visual tap metronome that shows a beating heart in sync with the tempo. I can easily move it from electric to acoutic, and Amazon's pricing is so low I am considering getting one for each of my guitars. This is one of the few 5 star ratings I've given any product on Amazon and I rate a lot.\n",
            "104 Excellent product fit perfectly in my Epiphone pr-5. I think it did change the sound a little bit, it has more sustain. Very nice look.\n",

            "107 This microphone is durable, loud, and clear. I got this to improve the sound of the Blowing Up podcast and it did wonders for cutting back on noise.  I've also used it for live sound and actually like it more than my SM-58.  It also looks and feels very nice, if you care about that.\n",
            "108 These are heavy and feel pretty sturdy. They fit sturdy and were easy to install. They are darker than in the pics in the product discription. The color is black chrome.\n",
            "109 Over the period of a month, one of the two cables failed. When I unplugged it, the actual quarter inch end broke off as I was pulling the cable out as I normally do at the end of practicing or a show, and got stuck in my amp so thanks to this, I have to spend money and time that I don't have to get my amp fixed with the broken cable and buy a better, stronger, more durable cable that won't break when I pull it out of the amp.\n",
            "110 I love this guitar. You can have a clean tone or a crunch tone which is perfect for what I play. It was my first bass and I got it at a local used gear shop. I have had it for a little over a year and it has been through a lot. It sounds great and it is REALLY durable and can go through a lot. I have played this bass every where I have played\n",

            "113 Have never tried these before- just put them on two of my basses. I usually play a set of strings 'til a string breaks- so a very long time. After about a month of playing they still sound fairly new, I think they sound good, feel good, and have even response up and down and across the fretboard.\n",
            "114 I have to give these pickups 5 stars for bang for buck!  I bought this last year for an 96' Korean Squire that I have been slowly but surely replacing everything on as a learning project.  Time marched on and I finally put them in tonight and all I have to say is Wow!  The difference in these and the originals is just off the scale.  I never realized how much amp hiss I was getting until I plugged these in for the first time.  I had to actually hit a string to make sure it was working.  I can not say enough good things about these affordable pickups.  I have another MIM strat with some boutique pickups that are marketed as noiseless but I honestly believe I actually like the tone of these better for a fraction of the cost. If you have an old Strat laying around these are the pickups you need to bring it roaring back to life.  I have attached a pic for those who wonder how the covered pickups look installed.\n",
            "115 Bought these for my Peavey Raptor Plus EXP that I'm currently rebuilding. The screw was a bit longer than the one that was for the original string tree, so it took a bit longer and had to use a little bit of elbow grease to fully get it screwed it. But once it was tight, it looks great and matches the rest of the gold hardware on the guitar. I would recommend this to anyone looking to build a Partscaster, upgrade the string trees, or do as I'm doing and getting all gold hardware for their guitar.\n",

            "117 I bought 4 to use for my pedal board that I just made. Upon opening the first one, it was not one continuous piece. It was cut towards one end and as I unrolled it, a shower of the black mushroom nubs came falling out (see picture). Hmm...maybe just a bad roll. I opened the second one. This one was one continuous piece, and only a few nubs fell out. Ok, lets test it out. I attached it to itself and pressed it together. Nice grip. Then I pulled it apart, and several bunches of nubs came tearing out as well. If I'm going to attach something to my pedal board that will bond permanently, I don't want  something that will tear itself apart and leave bald patches every time I move a pedal. I'm sure it would work fine, if you don't move things around, but just the idea that I can't do it do often doesn't sit well. Oh well, expensive lesson learned. Get the 3M instead. I have used it in the past. Good stuff.\n",

I definitely will recommend this to every artist and/or mixing engineer to get a clean, quality recording. Its cheap, so the price will not be a big problem for you. You see a pop filter in most studios these days, and don't worry about yours not being the most expensive or the most advanced. Most of the time, you can get the same job done with the equipment you have. So keep it up. This project won't let you down.\n",

There is an extra piece of removable padding on the inside that I placed along the side of my ukulele for a very nice, snug fit. I was looking for a hard case that had a pair of backpack straps, which this model does. I don't know if all the colors have that, but I was told that the red, white and champagne colored cases have the removable backpack straps. The straps are also nicely padded. Really if there was anything I would find fault with is that it is a rather heavy case, being fiberglass. But that's a price I'm happy to pay for the bombproof security this case affords my expensive Pono ukulele.\n",
            "134 This was an eBay buy to flip. Not a bad Bass guitar. Just not worth much, used or new. The bridge pickup is very noisy. The pickups are not an active pickup. If they were an Active pickup without the BOOM sound, then I would say its a 4 star. Everything is about the same as the GSR200 as far as body, neck, and bridge. Mine was a $79 buy new and a $119 flip. Its an ok Bass guitar after a string change and a setup. This is more of a first time Bass buyer who is learning to play.\n",
            "135 This black guard fit perfectly on my squier affinity telecaster that I was doing my rendition of macawber(Keith Richards telecaster). Very impressed with how well it was made.

But all mounting screw holes lined up and I didn't have to do any fit work that you have to do most of the time, even on more expensive pick guards sometimes. I am very happy with how it looks and fits, I do really like the matte finish of it too.\n",
            "136 I'm using this brilliant connector from my iPad retina (running a sequencing app) to a Roland MC-303. Works perfect. Having this connector opens up a whole world of new tech and old tech compatibilities. I'm sure it works great for using USB controllers for Midi as well, since that's really what it was designed for. If you are looking to incorporate your iPad into Midi world, get this now.\n",
            "137 I bought It to replace my Squier II's bridge, It has improved the resonance and sustain, the item was described as \"Mexi\" so I thought It was made in Mexico, but It's made in Taiwan... Anyway It's a genuine Fender part and now with a few dollars my guitar sounds better.\n",
            "138 I'm a long time musician, and a long time user of Ernie Ball Strings (on electric guitars). Unfortunately, I can't endorse these strings, even though they sound great and the light gauge saves my fingers. The problem is that they break, in my humble opinion, excessively easily. I put a set on and broke a g string within 2 days of moderate use. It snapped near the saddle, so I didn't think much of it. I replaced the set, and within a few more days I noticed that the wrapping on the g string was broken and becoming unraveled near my third fret. I bought 7 sets, so I still have 5 more sets to go through, but honestly I'll probably go back to elixirs when these are gone, since they seem to last longer.\n",
            "139 This is legit everybody is may only be 20$ but it's plug and play no special knobs or knobs just get your phantom 48v and your ready ... This is used for like the floureon mic or the Neewer mic or the Tonor mic they all work with this\n",
            "140 As I am sure that you know, this is a Fulltone OCD clone and let me tell you that it is the closest to a perfect clone in sound as you can get. I love this pedal and because of this one will probably be buying many more Joyo products. I wasn't a huge fan of the paint job on the product so I pulled it apart and used ceramic resin engine paint to coat it. I love this pedal and would recommend it to anyone!\n",
            "141 We installed ours at the heel of the neck having ordered extra guitar strap buttons. My wife loves it on her new Alvarez AU90T tenor uke. She immediately contrasted the soft cotton fabric with an old synthetic guitar strap I had pulled out.\n",
            "142 I bought this bag for my double kick pedals.  It's a great bag for that purpose.  The pedals fit perfectly, and the fur lining helps protect them .  The exterior pocket is perfect for the beaters, link bar, and any other accessories you need.  I would highly recommend this bag to anyone looking for an inexpensive way to transport and protect your double pedals.  The only thing I would like to see added to it is a divider between the pedals.\n",
            "143 Fit my 2007 MIUSA Strat which I purchased gutted and I'm slowly getting parts for. I just got the switch and machine heads and I still need the Pick-Ups. Since it's an 07 I felt that I could hot rod with out getting ostracized for it. I'm also going to do a hand carved inlay on the body. The guitar is being built for a give away to commemorate 19 years serving Indie Music. The image is a 1977 Fender MusicMaster MIUSA, the part I got is the same going on a Fender Strat\n",
            "144 Very sturdy , easy to set up and take down . If you need a light stand and price is an issue, I would recommend this product.\n",

Most reviews I've seen recommend new strings and a different bow, neither of which I had. The bridge was already set in place. So, on Christmas morning, she popped in a 9v battery, tuned it up with the existing strings, rosined up the bow that came with it and plugged it into a small amplifier, which resulted in the attached video.\n",
            "146 You can do a lot with this mixer. its great for podcasting. has 4 outputs that can be used to monitor, record, cue audio...The mute to 3/4 figure on every channel is fantastic and the three source switch to headphone/control room is a must for podcasting. Also has aux return inputs that can be used as extra stereo inputs and be volumed by the aux return knobs.\n",
            "147 These DR's sounds great! Looks good on my MusicMan Sterling Ray34 Bass (Will be back with update review) Update: After playing for an half an hour (4 times out of the week) G String went dead, followed by the D ...I'm going to try the new Rotosound NXB45 Nexus Bass Black Polymer Coated Hybrid Strings (Good Reviews)\n",
            "148 The quality of this bass trap is amazing. I record all kinds of music and when mastering a song with heavy bass leads I need to hear it as clearly as possible. This works perfectly. I have trouble hearing someone speaking on the other side of the room. I may have over done it, but the room is so muffed from any sound its almost erie... Well worth the money! By the way, when I'm not recording I use this room to play Xbox One on. The bass is so crisp and clear. Its better then a movie theater!\n",

            "150 This light is awesome!!! Very bright with 54 one watt diodes. Throws a nice medium wash they are great. The only down side I have with them is a power cable being attached to the fixture instead of an iec cable. It has dmx in and out. The housing is a very tough plastic and also includes the hanging bracket. The par is a flat par which is great for up lighting. I think this is a great fixture so I give it a 5 stars\n",
            "151 Simply beautiful. Excellent quality. It is a bit long since Im only 5 and play with my guitar fairly high up. I just cinch it as much as itll go and its just right.\n",
            "152 Arrived in 2 days with prime in safe packaging. Minor paint flaws with semi gloss finish. Plywood and plastic construction with painted plastic fretboard. Has plastic tuning keys and metal tuning gears on headstock. Paint wore away quickly on the side of fretboard at the top of the neck. The strings on the ukulele are not of quality but the ukulele can take brand name strings and tune them correctly. The bridge and nut need filing in order to effectively play chords or scales so I would consider it a novelty uke. Perfect for a toddler or young child to use instead of an expensive instrument, but will not be good to learn on or take lessons with. False spruce top and stained mahogany back and sides give it an expensive look that kids will love. Adult supervision required as there are moving parts. I bought this for my son who is turning two years old this May. See photo for comparison of an acoustic guitar (spruce top, catalpa back and sides) vs. the soprano ukulele\n",
            "153 Very nice product! Really really love it! I hope these last long time! Highly recommended! Better effect with a fog machine!\n",
            "154 This is a great idea and I was surprised at how well the suction cup adheres to my guitar's surface.  However, if you are going to rely on it for a gig, then I would attach at least two as your hand or any brushing against something firm can knock it off.  In other words, it isn't as sticky as adhesive.  But, for most situations, it certainly does the trick and can removed in an instant and does not deface the guitar surface in any fashion.  It does come with a medium thickness, pink pick that is halfway decent.  While I am not crazy about the color, I quickly realized that it is easy to see against the strings and surface of the guitar.\n",
            "155 This thing works great. I hooked it up to my ATR2100 along with a NEEWER scissor arm (without a shock mount) and I did some tests to see how my plosives were. It makes a great difference, especially since you have to get pretty close to this type of microphone (dynamic). It may be a cheap buy, but it's definitely quality and does what it needs to.\n",
            "156 Gamechanger mixer. One of the few things that has been made in this century that is decent. I use it in a studio rack that replaced a Mackie 1202VLZ, a Yamaha REV500 DSP and a Behringer 31 band DEQ2496. Was a little reluctant to replace all these devices, but over time I gave in as I learned/experimented more with this mixer. I control it with an IPAD Air 2- prefer it over Android as I can place the RTA, the EQ and the channel strip all on the same screen without having to toggle. My only small gripe is that updates and development of the IOS XAir app have not been much of a priority (2 years between 1.42 and 1.5?) . It can be a little overwhelming- after 6 months, I'm still learning more about it and that's a good thing- they'res stuff I can do with this mixer that I could not do with any analogue mixer I've had/used. Love the idea that I can take the IPAD and roam.\n",
            "157 All I can say is I'm loving it.\n",
            "158 I installed a set of these on my Epiphone G400 Pro. They offer better prevention of guitar straps slipping off than the stock strap buttons provide. These pins also have a lower profile than the stock pins. They are a single piece pin, versus strap lock that have two pieces that lock together. Installation was very easy and the provided hardware fit with no issues. These strap pins give me piece of mind and they look awesome too!\n",
            "159 This USB guitar/instrument cable lets you connect an electrical musical instrument to a PC directly through the USB port. This takes a few minutes to auto-install the drivers when you plug it in. Once installed it worked smoothly. It seems to be solidly constructed and it fits fine on both the USB plug and the guitar. Take note that it was listed on my computer as a headphone device rather than an instrument cable, so don't get confused by how it is listed in the USB devices. I would say this is worth trying if you want a USB musical instrument cable. I received a discounted sample for my honest, unbiased review.\n",
            "160 IMO this is the best and only way to mount toms, especially Pearls.  My Session kit came with them and with the heavy 6 play maple toms have never had a single issue with tuning, bouncing, lug stress whatsoever.  I think after you use them for a while you can take them for granted and don't fully understand how sturdy they are until you use another suspension system.  I recently purchased a Pearl Birch Vision kit for my wife which came with Pearl's I.S.S. mounting system.  To be fair I've never used them, and in the case of the new kit they came right off, and the Optimounts went right on.  Even though these are not the aluminum (more expensive and slightly lighter) Masterworks version, I feel they not only work for what they're intended, but they also accent the drum shells without being intrusive.  Most drummers buy, skin, and play for sound, but showing off your nice wood shells never hurts.  I can't think of a single negative, except that they're not free.  :)\n",
            "161 I'm going to give this a five stars.  It may feel fragile or not strong enough ones you open the mail, but it's a very good product and feels strong, ones you install it.  That's also easy to do.  Check out the pictures I posted. I'm happy\n",
            "162 This stuff cleaned up and made my Gibson songwriter shine like new.  Thank you very much,  Chris\n",
            "163 It's very nice. It can hold my Casio px160 even with the stand on.\n",
            "164 Hey hey\n",
            "165 Quality of sound is good. My only problem is bottom part of the amp is peeling off like in the picture in about 2 years. I never took the amp outside nor put it on the floor. Always kept in my room on the amp stand. Also I'm not a heavy user of the amp I just practice once a week or so.\n",
            "166 I love this guitar! I honestly never held a Squire brand strat before, but compared to everything I've held, played, and heard in the past; this guitar really gives you the best bang for your buck. Especially if you're like me and pretty much poor as dirt. I thought that with this guitar being so cheap I'd probably want to get some small upgrades, but I'm pretty content with what I got after the first 10 minutes of playing.\n",
            "167 Very sturdy and professional boom arm. Worth the money and definitely built to last.\n",
            "168 These SKRIMS are a little bit pricy but they are simply awesome, a friends band borrowed mine to impress a club owner, They will be buying these soon. They have a hook at the top that slips around the tightening screw on your speakers and with a par Can light underneath these are simply put.. Impressive!!!\n",

            "170 I must have have gotten lucky? All mine are gorgeous, and with a tweak or two, bridge tweak, neck twea k, string height tweak, I am still in shock that a vintage , large headstock, 50's style Strat...the look, finish, and playability are rare in discounted axes! Hey, each and every piece screams FENDER. My studio wall is very, pinkies up! ...classy,  so much, for so little!\n",
            "171 I like Tascam products. I have a rack mounted digital recorder, a CD player and a small digital recorder. The 100mkII is also a very good recorder but I have some complaints: The battery life is short maybe because it uses only 2 cells. The volume control is very close to the phone jack making adjustment a bit dificult. The door of the AA cells seems the door of a cheap toy; it could be more robust. Apart from these minor details I'm well satisfied with the product.\n",
            "172 These wall hangers are superb. I don't understand why others of inferior quality cots twice as much. These are made out of solid wood (looks like Pinewood) glazed over with weather protective urethane. The great thing about this is that it supports all sizes of guitars, from small Ukuleles to full size. That is due to the rubber rings which they include to avoid smaller necks falling out. Another very nice thing is that the arm is screwed into a wood nut, which makes it super secured while allowing for movement in case you have odd neck shapes (like fender strats) which require a little angle.\n",
            "173 Purchased the 5-hole pickguard in eggshell for my MIM Baja Telecaster. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much since I hated the cheap, white plastic version that came stock. Black Bakelite looked good, gold anodized aluminum looked better, but somehow this one just seems right. It's a heavy, vintage thickness, rigid, and very high quality. The eggshell color adds just enough warmth as well. There is no shielding so you may want to slap some copper foil on the back.\n",
            "174 Perfect Fit!! Color match is very close.  Great product!! Added pickguard to a Les Paul Studio Deluxe..\n",
            "175 Good quality for a fair price, but it does indeed sag with heavier weight needs support. I placed 2x20# on the shelf and it sagged about 1/4. Overall a good product. If tasked with supporting small weights, it will likely be a perfect choice.\n",
            "176 The kit shipped the following day from the distributor after my placing the order, arriving ahead of schedule. It took me a couple of hours to set it up and position the components to my liking. Adjusting the sounds, tones and volume of each device was rather straightforward. For the price, I am pleasantly surprised with the action of the cymbals and pads. Sounds great when recording as well. I highly recommend this kit for someone who doesn't want to spend a fortune, but would like a functional, professional-sounding electronic drum set that can take a beating and not take up a whole lot of space. I drum left-handed and placed everything accordingly. High-five to Acorn.\n",

            "179 This is a good stand for the price. However, the mandolin seems to sit on the floor and this supports it.  Its good that it's on a rug, but I wouldn't place this on hardwood directly if you are worried about the finish of you instrument.\n",

            "181 I needed an inexpensive set of tuners for a low budget bass project and these fit.  While the lower quality does exhibit itself during tuning, they do work.  As long as one doesn't expect quality at this price point, they do the job.  I've had them mounted on the bass for about a month now, and they don't hold the tune as well as Hipshot, Grover, or other quality tuners, but I am happy with the performance at this price.\n",
            "182 I've had this tuner for about 4 years and it's been great. It tunes fine. For a long time the tuner just sat in my room, but recently I started taking the tuner around to practice and transporting it in my bag. Unfortunately one of the 3 plastic pieces where the gooseneck attaches to the tuner broke off. It still works but the head sometimes falls off of the tuner. Now I'm looking for a clip on tuner that is a little more durable. If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know.\n",
            "183 I'm using several of these on a wall I built. The hangers work great with several different head-stock shapes. I wish there were available bands, straps or locking devices to keep instruments secure here in earthquake prone California. I ended up using velcro strips under the hangers that affix over the fretboard. Otherwise a great hanger..\n",
            "184 Perfect for my EC-1000S EMG. Been using D'addario for years and they never disappoint me. Even on a shorter scale guitar there is enough tension to keep them tight.\n",
            "185 The normal adapters to be able to mount an Apogee MiC onto a regular microphone stand are about $20 for a made-for-the-purpose one or about $10 for a camera adapter which can be made to work (kind of ugly looking though, in my opinion).  What I did was to buy this adapter for less than $2 and then I ground off flush the screw stem on it.  I then used a small 1/8\" drill bit to drill a hole large enough to allow the Apogee's OEM tripod's screw to be able to attach this adapter to the swivel adapter part of the factory Apogee tripod.  Sounds complicated but it was super easy to do, works great and saved some money.\n",
            "186 For the money they aren't bad but that doesn't mean they are good. Loud highs and lows get fuzzy and the over all doesn't sound great but for a small gig band or a backup Mics these are great! The only prob I have with them is that the mic mount doesn't fit on like any mic stand I have AND BUY A CHEEP POP FILTER FOR THIS MIC OR YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!!\n",
            "187 Are use this to hang my electric guitar on the wall and it was super easy install it looks great and Im super happy with the purchase.\n",
            "188 I'm actually impressed by this mic.  For the price, assuming yours works out of the box, you can't really go wrong.  I bought two for podcasting and plug them directly into my mixer and the sound quality is excellent.  They seem well made (time will tell) and, again, the price was excellent.  Heck, they even look good.  :)\n",
            "189 Love it. Great product. Does exactly what I want it to do. Hold up my guitar!!  Sturdy construction. No complaints. I love it!\n",
            "190 The way these are shipped all scrunched up may make you nervous, but don't worry. They'll be fine.\n",
            "191 You shouldn't have to buy RPS to get strings you can bend.... I have been using Ernie Ball Super Slinkies since the 1980s. I love the feel and sound they produce. but I'm done. I have seen too many .09, .10 .11 and .13 strings slip and let go lately. Could it be that it is impossible or too expensive to make them with quality US-made steel?\n",
            "192 Dont waste your money. Worst clip on tuner I have ever owned. I purchased this to use on a 2nd acoustic guitar. It is very difficult to get the guitar in tune with this tuner. It hunts all over the place looking for the proper note.\n",
            "193 Great Stand!  I use for my Native Instruments Maschine Studio hardware. I hope it lasts long.\n",

The jaws are lined with a grippy foam that hugs the lipstick-sized C-2s but also caresses the tapering ice cream cone body of, say, a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Shure-SM58/dp/B000CZ0R42/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Shure SM58</a>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Samson-R21/dp/B000IJ9GU8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Samson R21</a>.  They're compact enough to fit the case that comes with the Behringer mics and priced for the musician on a budget.\n",
            "195 This dampener works OK, but man it is really clumsy and obtrusive. When it's in the up position you can poke someone's eye out. You're better off learning to use the palm of your hand at the bridge of your guitar to dampen or muffle the sound or try tying a \"hanky\" (handkerchief) at the top of the neck.\n",
            "196 I'm more happy with this purchase than anything I've bought recently.  It's just great.  It's simple, sturdy, well-built, and it holds my dreadnought guitar perfectly.  No room for improvement that I can find in this product.\n",
            "197 These are excellent clamps! I have no idea where the poor ratings below are coming from, for 35mm diameter truss tubing like the TRUSST systems (or any 35mm or 1-3/8\" OD tubing ) these clamps fit like a glove, clamp tightly, have beautiful surface finish that won't scratch, flawless bolt and wingnut hardware, and work perfectly. Will also clamp securely to 1-1/4\" OD tubing. The roll pins that secure the two halves and the toggle bolt are all firmly and properly fitted as well. I got 5 to try since they were such a great price and after receiving them went back for 10 more. These will not work on 1-1/2\" or 1\" or even 1-1/8\" tubing, get the other models for that, measure your tubing! These are also great for putting a light on top of a speaker tripod stand, most of which have a 1-3/8\" tube on top, add the clamp and bolt on your light.\n",
            "198 This was an easy installation. Used it on a recent tele build. Fits right in with hand pressure. Used some light taps with a rubber mallet to seat a few that weren't exactly flush.\n",

            "200 I so love the simplicity and ease of usage of this AxeRig Tuner!\n",
            "201 This is my 2nd Donner DP-1. The first was purchased to replace a noisy daisy-chain supply. Ran 8 effects, including the Line 6 DL4 (with the reverse polarity adapter) without any noise, power interruptions, or channel failures. From what I understand (after a lot of reading/research), these seem to be independent channels, but share a common ground. I'm not an electrician, but I do know that whether I'm running through my amp at home, or through the PA at church, I'm getting zero noise. Quite content with these.\n",
            "202 These knobs are exactly what I needed for the finishing touch on my Fender Jaguar Bass.\n",
            "203 I never knew this thing existed. I'm so glad I found this as I was always using a regular capo and placing it on just the 5 strings but the grip and placement was awkward and didn't provide a confident grip. Using this allows good grip. I use this a lot to practice my finger-picking songs...gotta love that low E, open string, bass note. Thank you Planet Waves for making this and in a simplistic yet convenient form.\n",
            "204 These are amazing! Not just for the price, they are just really great pickups. I rapped mine with friction tape over copper foil tape to fight against cheap wiring in my home.\n",
            "205 Works great. Improves audio greatly on the BMPCC. So versatile. I can rig it to a camera plug in an external Mic or use it all by itself as a recorder. Not to fond of the thin plastic makes it feel like a cheap toy but it's lightweight and works great.\n",
            "206 I bought a used MIM strat that came with a black pick guard and creamish colored pickups. The guitar was great but the pick guard wasn't my style. I put this on and now I love the look of this guitar. Highly recommend.\n",
            "207 They're pretty decent panels for what it's worth. By far they're not professional grade, but I think they can do well for a small home studio. They are fairly thin, so initially it's going to absorb higher frequencies better than lower frequencies, so keep that in mind.\n",
            "208 Well...it plays perfectly, but the once clear, white on blue lettering rubs right off. Body's natural oils... rub whatever paint they use. I'm considering buying a perm marker in a bright color and drawing them on again. Yes, the gold side is embossed, so it won't rub off, but it's the blue on white that a person looks to for quickly identifying notes. Long-term, it's more about the pitches being stable/etc., but I'm disappointed that only after three uses, the lettering is rubbing off. Put a better finish on these things...coat it with something non-toxic, but non-reactive with oils/acids from people's fingers since that's what we'll be using when we hold the things. Other than storage at home, the soft pouch is useless.\n",
            "209 The metal G is wound and wrapped in plastic to keep it separate.  Great sound, but admittedly I haven't tried any other brand.\n",
            "210 The picture doesn't do this bridge justice, I was skeptical of the quality when I ordered this Tremolo bridge but was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. I wasn't so concerned with the quality because I planed on using it on an old broken down imported Kramer ST300 that I refinished. I gave it a 3 because of the screws it takes a lot of hand strength to get the screws seated. You have to be very careful that you don't strip the philip screw heads the screw driver doesn't quit fit the number 2. I'll take the guitar to my shared work shop to see if a larger screw driver fits better.\n",

            "213 This pedal works fine until it breaks, but they WILL break with any kind of moderate use.  The bottom portion is two pieces, and after a little time the plastic which connects the \"pedal\" to the \"frame\" breaks.  It's done it the same way in all of the ones I have.  I've been through about 4 of these in the last 3 years at my church, with two keyboard players using them each week on two separate instruments.  Each of the two keyboards/sustain pedals get used once per week, for about 20 minutes.  I don't think this is enough use to break so consistently.  Our work-around is something firm like a piece of floor tiling on the bottom and a whole lot of duct tape.\n",
            "214 I have been using these straps for at least six years. I have never had them fail once. The tweed material is strong, durable and gets softer the longer you use it. I always attach Dunlop strap locks to my guitars and knowing the metal link in the strap is a great added protection as opposed to the plastic which can break.\n",
            "215 My oldest son plays and owns many guitars. He asked for a new guitar strap for Christmas. I ordered this one because we are Irish and I thought it looked really cool.\n",
            "216 I really love playing this guitar. Every since I received it, it has been by my side. Full sized neck. Sustain is fantastic. It stays in tune even with new strings. Fits perfectly in my suitcase. Will be taking it on all my vacations. I added the foam to the lap rest for a little more comfort while sitting on my lap. Plus, to prevent it from sliding when sitting. If you want a great travel guitar or even a guitar to play around the house, this is the one to get.\n",
            "217 I could not imagine this product was so small but so powerful at the same time. I am using it in my analog mastering room, as a media reader. Especially interesting for the bluetooth connectivity. Connecting the output to one input of a Samson C Control studio controller, and there you go... send the sound wherever you want to direct it in the studio.\n",
            "218 Arrived 3 days after I ordered it, the bent welding should've clued me to what would happen. 2nd time I tuned it the inferior quality tension bolts started stripping, making the macho (small drum) useless. Mostly good materials (oak, steel, rawhide) + terrible craftmanship = drum being returned. Lay down another $30 and get some Aspires, I've gotten 2 sets of those (1 for me, 1 as a gift) and they won't let you down, or you might want to check out similarly priced bongos from Meinl, Gon Bops or Tycoon, but avoid this hunk a junk.\n",
            "219 I bought It to storage my Epiphone Les Paul Standard, It fits perfect, the inside is soft, this case provides a great protection, It's a little heavy, but I think this is the best choice for a epi LP.\n",
            "220 First of all the weight of the keys is absolutely perfect. Second I was hoping that the settings when you play softly or stabbed the keys where almost as accurate as a real grand piano. This is amazing. If you play softly, hitting the keys like a feather, it delivers the signal to the daw flawlessly. I was on a budget when I bought this, I was contemplating waiting for a more expensive one but needed it asap for a project. I'm very happy with this!\n",
            "221 When you buy aftermarket pickup rings, lining up the mounting holes is a concern... however, these lined up perfectly with the holes on my Dean Schenker V.  They are for a flat-top guitar, so if you try to mount them on a Les Paul, which is arched, you'll have problems.  Make sure the pickup rings you order are for the right type of top.\n",
            "222 Good fit on my Epiphone Les Paul.\n",
            "223 You really cant beat it for the price, however, I would not use it for really heavy lights. Its only rated for 50lbs anyway. If you have some LED fixtures, a couple lasers (attached picture).... then this is perfect. Heavy scanners, and other large format lights (even if only using one ~40 lbs) I would not use. It only feels secure enough for a couple smaller lights and a fogger. Just buy it!!! You could always use it in your entertainment center and or, mobile DJ rig for some sort of light application.\n",
            "224 For the money, it is awesome.  I upgraded the transmitter cord, and it cured some of the cable noise. (The one included is a bit long and cheap).  It has a clear sound and good battery life. Plus, the receiver is small enough to fit on my pedal board.\n",
            "225 I love this thing its so convenient to use at my desk! It's sturdy enough for my all metal, b1 conderser mic! I wouldn't use any heavier of a mic though. The shock mount s decent to!! The arm has a decent enough reach for my big desk! Zero complaints.\n",

            "227 On the day these picks arrived I went to a gig and put one in my pocket while I set up my gear.  Maybe twenty minutes later, I took the pick out of my pocket and found it had already shed the cork \"grip\".\n",
            "228 My stand came in and it was larger than I expected!! However, I like its features. It can expand to 4 different wide settings. It's perfect and very strong for my bass. Thanks!\n",
            "229 We use these for everything from our acoustic bass down to our ukuleles. I know there is a smaller model available for ukes, violins, etc.; we haven't yet ordered those, but these will work on smaller instruments if one doesn't extend the feet to their maximum width. They're gentle on the instruments, and the grippy material keeps them secure.\n",
            "230 I've been carrying mine around for about ten years, using it as it was designed: easy carry so you can sing \"Kumbaya\" with the gang around the camp fire without disturbing the neighbors.  It has seen a lot of smoke and a lot of salt spray at the beach.  It is NOT a full guitar so don't expect it to act, feel, play, look or sound like one.  It is NOT a beginners' guitar and I would never recommend it as such.\n",
            "231 Was skeptical after reading previous reviews. Very happy with this chair. To be used for saxophone playing. Very easy to assemble as most is already put together. The backing of the backrest and seat isn't the greatest, but will do. The backrest does clank, but a trip to the hardware store and pick up those cork round pads for cabinets, problem solved. This chair is comfortable to me and sturdy enough. I gambled and won with this chair.\n",
            "232 Great quality, good design, look expensive.\n",
            "233 Works fine. There were no instructions. Well actually there were, but they were not in English. It's pretty self explanatory though. Great deal.\n",
            "234 This is a wonderful gig bag! I've included pictures of the more popular styles of guitar so you can see how well they fit. The purple Les Paul style fits snug length wise with the extra cushion pads, and fits snug side to side. The black Stratocaster style is ALMOST to long, but still fits fine. The grey SG style is a small guitar, so there is extra room top to bottom and side to side, but with the neck strap, it doesn't slide around too much, and I would still feel comfortable using this bag with the SG. The padding is aproximently an inch think all around and top and bottom, and the zippers are of good quality.\n",
            "235 I own a Yamaha 61 keys Keyboard and I ordered this stand because the product description says it is Yamaha make. But what is written on the box is:'Keyboard Stand For Portable Keyboards from Yamaha and Others' and there is no Yamaha emblem neither on the box nor on the stand. In fact, it is just a Chinese make generic stand. Apart from that, I am happy with the stand. It is:\n",
            "236 Better thab the terrible string trees my guitar had,  had to drill a small hole though to mount as yoy can see in the pics\n",
            "237 Works Great ...was easy to Install ....Love it\n",
            "238 I bought these for my office. I wanted to put a barrier between the speaker phone and the wall to help reduce echo and keep my nosy neighbor from listening in. I can't tell if you if it works for the neighbor but the echo is gone now. I also have my computer speakers near them as well and that seems to shield a little noise too.\n",
            "239 OK I gave these tuners a 5 and I've not installed them on the Fender Strat they're intended for. Made in the USA machine heads is what I wanted for the MIUSA Strat. I'm doing a custom Strat to raise funds for my web site which is dedicated to Indie Music. I bought this guitar gutted and still need Pick-Ups and hand carved inlay. I will update when I string the guitar and play a few licks.\n",
            "240 I think the amount of positive feedback these mics are receiving should tell you something about how amazing they sound. I just simply want to say that if you purchase these mics, do yourself a huge favor and buy a 6\" gooseneck! I use my Spirits for drum overheads and apart from them sounding incredible, adding a little gooseneck makes this a perfect microphone. The internal shock absorption is actually really impressive! Amazing mics for the money! Grab you a couple!\n",
            "241 It's a tuner and a good one for the price...makes me happy. Love behringer\n",
            "242 Sadly, these strings were suggested as replacements for a Yamaha Guitalele GL-1.\n",
            "243 I really really loved these till this happened at a gig last night ( see picture)\n",
            "244 I put a 10 splash cymbal on this cymbal arm. Works great! I would suggest putting a small piece of rubber under the metal clamp. The one that comes attached is thin and doesnt protect from metal to metal contact.\n",
            "245 All I can say is wow! This has to be the best amp at this price. I chose this over the fender and I'm glad I did. It is clean-sounding smooth has a great tone nice design easily move it around even though it does weigh over 30 lb. This is a bargain I'm glad I went with this brand. The size is big enough to punch out for mid sized church functions with ease! The pic doesn't really show u the size. It's bigger than the pic puts out. No distortion just a clean bass sound... Again A bargain and I will buy a bigger one in the future!\n",
            "246 This is a good buy\n",
            "247 Highly recommend. It did wonders for my Kremona Solea. It's like a totally different guitar. Much more lively.\n",
            "248 I put a set of these on a Jag I finished up a few weeks ago and I'm thoroughly impressed.\n",
            "249 bought this to slap on a cheap p bass from e-bay. I figured if it sucks, its only a few bucks.\n",
            "250 I'm using these high hats for a small kit ,( Pearl Rhythm traveler drum set. ) and they give a good sizzle. For the price that you're paying these little guys give you a great sound. I wouldn't get these if you're planing on playing \"pro live shows\", or recording. I have a pair of zildjian titanium cymbals / high hats and you can tell the difference. These high hats don't hold / sustain their sound for too long. If you're playing rock beat or just starting off.. These are a great starter set, and for the price you can't really disagree. A must have for a start to advanced player.\n",
            "251 Just out these beauty's on my Mitchell and they are perfect. I wanted to add character to my guitar and this definitely helps.\n",
            "252 I'm pretty happy with this string action gauge. It's a sturdy piece of stainless steel with easy to read numbers and measurements etched into the steel. Definitely worth the money paid. A must have for anyone who sets up their own guitars.\n",
            "253 Great kit after leveling and crowning the frets this guitar plays great I love this kit\n",
            "254 Great look. Great product. Great buy!!!!\n",
            "255 Great picks, the best holding pick ever, more of a medium flex.\n",
            "256 These fit my Samson meteor Mic nicely. Also fits great on Zoom H2n. Snug. Good standard foam not thin like some others. Also trimmed one to put over my MSH6 Mic capsule.\n",
            "257 I settled on the Kelly Shu only after reading lots of reviews (of the Shu, May, and Gibraltar offerings). I chose the Shu because it seemed to be the most robust to physical abuse and offers varied placement options. I installed on my 16 x 16 inch Pearl Session floor tom conversion and attached an Audix D6--a rather substantial kick drum mic that is hangs pretty heavy toward the front. I got a little creative with the install, attaching all eight leather straps around the circumference of the drum and weaving the rubber cord (full length) back and forth around the Shu (see photos). I used the May no-drill vent hole mic cable adapter to wire it up. I'm very pleased with the design and quality of the Kelly Shu. Figuring out how to install it was a fun challenge--there were several options and I settled on the one that didn't require me to cut the rubber cord, just in case I change my mind.\n",
            "258 I bought this last week from another retailer. This is the best case I have ever purchased, but it's heavy as hell! I wasn't expecting it to be 150lbs empty.\n",
            "259 I've bought 2 of these as well as an instrument from this seller. The straps are very attractive and sturdy.\n",
            "260 Works great! I was happy with the length of the cables and how sturdy the jacks are. This is a great value, with good quality.\n",
            "261 Provided that this is not a Fender Telecaster but a Squier, I was pleasantly surprised by its playability and its tone. The three pick-up options make it very versatile for any type of music you may want to use it for. The difference in quality between this guitar model and the Squier by Fender Bullet Strat is incredible and well worth the $50 price increase.\n",
            "262 It fits my les paul copy that isn't exactly yhe same size as the lp but i wanted to see if it fits and it does. My epiphone is in the shop so i might as well use it for my other guitar.\n",
            "263 The naugahyde cover was lifting and the glue residue was tacky. The fit for my Tele was not as right. For my Schecter it was good.\n",
            "264 I love this strap! It's beautiful and comfy and fits great. Yes drilling into my uke was scary but there are really good videos out there that make it easy. The shoe string got in my way so I strapped it to the g string tuner. I dunno how smart that is but it's my life I can do what I want!\n",
            "265 tried something different rather than my daddario xl 10's ( nickels)...- they didn't seem as  as smooth  and  initially i thought they had too much bite  - overly bright not as balanced as the d'ad's 10 pure Nickel... BUT  after 2 days they have settled in and like all strings have  gotten some wear and sound much better!  very clear  and punchy - a tad bright for my style but  still good  im sure its perfect for many!- if they hold up for a decent spell ill adjust my review to 4 stars...they have -I did\n",
            "266 This thing works!  I use a DW 3000 Double-Pedal, and have had issues with the slave pedal sliding forward - even though it comes with it's own built-in spurs.  The DW's onboard spurs are about where the ball of the foot goes, so with the pedal jumping, even when extended all the way down, the pedal still moved (hopped?) forward.  I tried adding additional Velcro, but that didn't stop it.  But now, with the Pearl Pedal Stabilizer on the front of it, it stays put.  The Pearl's long spikes go deep into my old oriental carpet that I use as my drum rug at a perfect angle to restrict any forward movement.  Now I can really kick it hard!  Pleasantly surprised at how heavy-duty and large it is.  If your slave pedal has a hoop clamp on it, you're ready to go right out of the package.  The spikes also can be reversed with rubber tips for hard surfaces.  I don't really need that feature as my rug goes with me to gigs.\n",
            "267 Time will tell how it holds up...\n",
            "268 Poorly manufactured.  The plastic cushion top was only halfway attached.  See photo.\n",
            "269 It's definitely tiny. They weren't kidding about that. That being said, the screen is 1\"X1\", but pretty bright and easy to read. The colors are rich, which helps. I play 6, 7, and 8 string guitars and was able to tune all 3 with no problems. Quick detection, and accurate. Even the F# on the 8 string was picked up almost instantly.\n",
            "270 Awesome stand!\n",
            "271 This plate comes with a cheap, worthless jack installed in it. I was planning on throwing it away and installing a Switchcraft 11 jack in it instead. The mounting hole diameter was 9.5 mm, and the Switchcraft uses a 3/8\" mounting hole, so I needed to use a 3/8\" drill bit to widen the hole just slightly. 9.5 mm is .374 inches, so it is only one thousandth of an inch different, but did need to be expanded nevertheless. It also only came with 2 screws instead of the 4 needed. I had the four screws that came with the guitar anyway, from the plastic jack plate I was replacing, so that was no problem either. The screws were a bit bigger than the intended screws so it gave it a bit more of an industrial look that was unintentional but I think it looks good nonetheless. It was a little bigger than the old jack plate as well so I had to bondo in the screw holes and drill others out, but that's pretty much par for the course with aftermarket modifications of any sort.\n",
            "272 Simple, cost effective, no frills design that gets the job done. Hardly worth noting, but there are no mounting instructions. It should be intuitive, however.\n",
            "273 These are very sturdy and useful. I have one for gigs, one for busking, and a backup. I prefer hanging my violin on a stand than laying it in my case. It feels more secure and I have quick access.\n",
            "274 Worked great... for about 9 months. Then poof. Its dead. Fuse is fine (double checked with meter), was plugged into a power conditioner/surge protector. It just stopped working. No power at all. Learned my lesson, Behringer products just don't last.\n",
            "275 I love these great finish and quality\n",
            "276 This amp is the real deal.  Great crunch and gain tones and with some tweaking, not half bad clean\"ish\" tones.  I've played this through the two 8\" Orange cabs (had to get those too as they were just TOO cool ((and cute)) and not crazy money) and the sound is very pleasing and revealing for a practice amp.  I primarily play it through my Blackstar stack that I've fitted with Celestion V30s... Wow...there it is~!!!  You would never know this thing was such a tone monster... Even with just a few knobs it's easy to get lost for hours playing this thing.  My favorite match is with my Chapman ML-1 Hotrod...which only has a volume \"tone\" control (EVH fans get this).  Not a lot of mucking around with too many knobs or too many options on either the guitar or this amp... Just tone up and go.  I see the Micro Dark just came out...that's probably next~!  Higher gain, buffered effects loop and speaker emu at the headphone out for recording direct (if that's your thing).\n",
            "277 I purchased an old Yamaha E112C electric guitar that needed to be completely redone and I decided that I would replace the original chrome parts with Gold and the strap pegs look great. You can't see the strap pegs in the picture you do see the color and how the gold parts look.\n",
            "278 Fit my Epiphone Les Paul 100 perfectly.  Swapped out factory cream colored trim for these and they look great. Posting before and after pics\n",
            "279 I love this thing, I've used it for so many events now.\n",
            "280 Brass Tacks: is this the greatest mic in the world? No. But on a budget this mic is AMAZING. The lows and highs sound great and the mids sound well fleshed out. If you are looking for s nice rich sound, this is it.\n",
            "281 I installed these Grovers to my LTD and it went smooth as can be! Absolutly no problems. The strings I installed were new and held their tune far better than than new strings without the locking feature. I was a bit nervous because these do not have a button type to secure the strings. Grover has another mechanisim to lock the strings in place. It works great! Just make sure you hear the click! Its not loud so you may want to install these in a quiet place. Read the directions carefully and your all set. I put a set of the same Grovers on my cheapy Johnson hollowbody. Perfect fit!\n",
            "282 they sound good i found that the wiring is off but can be sequenced properly using this diagram colors are different but sequence is the same top left is hot, bottom left goes with ground/bare, two on right are together or can be used for tap\n",
            "283 I chose this cable b/c it was supposed to have the more durable metallic interfaces and superior strain relief as pictured. What showed up is nothing more than some cheap and flimsy cable that can be bought for a lot less elsewhere. I feel cheated.\n",
            "284 Freakin' sweet y'all!\n",
            "285 I had fun putting the kit together. I made a simple customization by adding two WWII  vintage decals (from etsy). Like most other builders, I swapped strings. I also re-arranged a few steps in the instructions. I will try to add photos showing the decals. (At the moment I do not see how to add photos).\n",
            "286 I  hooked up the light to a karaoke and mixer board very happy and pleased with her performance .  Lights are controlled by a DMX  DJ  Operating board .\n",
            "287 Go up 1 size. My hands are not large for my size and they are certainly not thick. I wear a size medium glove comfortably and large is almost always too big. Yet a size medium in these barely squeezes onto my pinky. Sizing is not close to accurate. Even used a heat gun to expand the opening slightly, no go. Just makes them wider bUT thinner. Disappointed\n",
            "288 This stand is great. Its light weight and sturdy base when extended to 9ft. It has screws for 8 lights so you can fit any size light on the T-bar. I have an Eliminator Lighting Katana LED, on one side and it takes up about 3 of the screw locations. You can fit a single projector light on this stand if you remove the T-Bar. Pictures show a close up of the screw that hold the t-bar/projector light.\n",
            "289 I used this on a custom bass build and it worked great!\n",
            "290 This stand is very portable and compact, but I no longer have confidence in it's ability to keep my electric basses safe. My vintage Fender Jazz Bass would not fit correctly due to the offset body shape and a few years ago it fell over causing significant damage to the headstock (see picture). After this, I resigned to use this stand only with my Fender Precision Bass which has a more symmetrical body shape, but even this bass has come close to falling over if not placed just so. I've decided to go back to the more traditional type of guitar stand for my instruments.\n",
            "291 A great product, which made a wonderful under-bed light in our application.\n",
            "292 I upgraded the bass and tom tom heads on my Pearl Rhythm Traveler kit (ASIN: B0002FO4R8) to these heads with amazing results. Before upgrading the open bottom toms had a lot of ring and were impossible to get the tone I wanted no matter how carefully I tuned them. I replaced the heads with these and was rewarded with an amazing difference in sound quality. The ringing, hollow quality I previously struggled to correct is now a nice \"thump\" sound that works perfectly with jazz and rock.\n",
            "293 great little stand , good price and fast prime shipping make this a good deal and value...i got it paired along with a ChromaCast small bench stool also folding...only down side was that the stand was missing one of the rubber end caps for the top crosspiece, so my keyboard is a little tippy and unstable....i'm trying to figure out how to get only the missing end cap piece and not have to return the whole stand,and wait for a replacement.\n",
            "294 Not real happy with this but then I wanted to save some money.  Not a very good decision on my part.  Should have shelled out the $30-35 for an actual Fender or Fender licensed pickguard so I'll eat this.  But I'm posting so YOU don't have to make my mistake.  Not knocking the company either, they tried but just didn't get it right.  See the pics.\n",
            "295 Needed something cheap but that worked for the bedroom. My main gear is upstairs in my studio but I often practice in my bedroom. I run a little Fender Champ combo in there and wanted some dirty tones for classic rock, blues and some heavier rock. This did the trick. Made of plastic but seems durable enough for my needs. Get some really cool tones out of this pedal. Can dial in almost any blues or rock tone I want. Was impressed by it for such a low cost pedal. For the money it was a very good choice.\n",
            "296 GREAT FIXTURE\n",
            "297 I loved this guitar stand at first b/c it held my Guild & Martin acoustics securely. After about a year of stationary use, the plastic housing which was responsible for holding up the neck support cracked and cannot be repaired (see pics). Since I'm past any warranty period, I'm stuck.\n",
            "298 This guitar is an amazing value!!! USA pups, chunky neck, and a fast fretboard (very round radius!) Its the kind of guitar you never want to put down. Switching options make it very versatile. My only criticism is the poly blonde finish is very plastic looking. Thankfully the grain is showing through more and more every day. I leave mine in the sun and may repaint in the future.\n",
            "299 Poor design doesn't line their own pedals up when connected using these. The offset isn't enough and results in each pedal along the line mounted a bit lower than the one next to it. As you can see in the picture, the third pedal from the chain is already almost off the board. How can they overlook this?\n",

            "303 Excellent, clear, punchy, great note definition. 60s rock, 70s R&B, modern jazz, this set covers it all. I build custom guitars and basses, have tried many different types and brands. These are my go to pickups. To be honest, I was a bit surprised at how articulate these are, as the SD quarter pound p-bass pickups are somewhat dark.\n",
            "304 I'd been searching for a while, to find a reverb pedal that would be able to fill the shoes of the built-ins that I'd used in the 60's and 70's... and here it is. Due to the unheard of low price, I half expected to get a \"half fast\" performance from this pedal, but fortunately, this was not the case. Upon plugging in the unit, and testing it with my Les Paul guitar, and my practice amp, I was amazed to hear how well this inexpensive pedal was able to replicate those old-school tones. This included emulation of multiple reverb types, such as  \"spring\", \"plate\", \"hall\", \"gate\", \"room\", and a really cool new one called \"modulate\" that throws a hint of chorus into it. Behringer not only got my money, but my respect and gratitude.\n",
            "305 This tailpiece is very solid and the plating and finish couldn't be better. So great for the price. I don't expect plating will stand contact/rubbing for long, but that's the case with most gold plated hardware, so I suggest any gold hardware be handled delicately. I know gold plating costs so much more than its price, so it's a bargain.\n",
            "306 Lets just start off by examining the price. At under twenty dollars you won't find many competitors, especially with this build quality. It is essentially an embroidery hoop with black pantyhose, an adjustable arm and screw clamp. Building one yourself will probably run you over twenty dollars and you will end up with an interesting mixture of distracting textures and colors, so why not just buy it instead? Functionally it works fine. It does muffle sound to some extent when stacked up against a metal mesh screen but for anything short of an audience of 50,000, it should appease just fine. all in all, if you are hitting annoying pops in your recording and don't want to spend a lot of money -- this is the way to go.\n",
            "307 For practical purposes, these patches are thin (which I like) and clear (if you get the clear ones).  They are not hard \"plasticky\" (yes, I made up a new word...remember you heard it here first) but have a snug, comfortable feel under the teeth. I use them on my OBrien crystal and Richard Hawkins Model G mouthpieces and they look great.  Now, the best thing about them for me personally is the R....my name is Robert.  Hah.  Looks like I have custom mouthpiece patches. ;-)\n",
            "308 I am 61 years old,been playing since 14. I have bought 4 or 5 Crescents over the years and have not found a lemon yet. These are great guitars!!!!!! I left the strings that came with it on,and after they quit stretching(like any set of strings will do)it stays perfectly tuned. I will be buying more to start a good collection and would highly recommend this to a friend. It is a keeper for sure!!\n",
            "309 In theory this is a great pedal but they are notorious for having problems freezing up. Mine is basically a paper weight right now. It has to go to a service center to be reset. From everything I've read on forums, odds are that it will probably freeze up again after being repaired. Hopefully not but I'm not feeling very optimistic. When / if TC gets the software to be more stable then this would be a fantastic product but until that happens I can't recommend it.\n",
            "310 It does what it's supposed to do, and does it well. A medium Fender pick measures .72 thick on my digital caliper. An Amazon gift card is the same and my expired driver license is ..78. My credit card is. 78. Expired cards will keep you in picks for a long time! The attached pic shows you can get 5 picks from a standard size card.\n",
            "311 The Pedaltrain is a bit pricey, but it keeps everything well organized and I have room for a few more pedals. I don't gig, but the board is solid and light, and the soft case seems sturdy enough for someone who will travel with their pedals. I purchased industrial strength velcro to mount my pedals, and i mounted my Donner power supply to the bottom of the board using velcro with no issues. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase, and my wife is happy that the area in front of my amp is no longer a rat's nest of cables and daisy chained pedals.\n",
            "312 This was a direct replacement for the black plastic tip on my lp studio. Works fine, looks great. No issues going on a year!\n",
            "313 Excellent microphone. No background noise, great clarity, great low end but a bit crunched on the high end.\n",
            "314 Really tough sound. Made out of plastic but it's both overdrive and distortion and everything in between.\n",
            "315 I bought a pair of these just over a year ago, at first they worked just fine then I started getting static when adjusting the Volume control to the point where the Main speaker was not playing but the other one was. Having bought then outside of the US it was very difficult to get the warranty honored so I decided to fix them myself as I am a technician. What I discovered was the volume controller which is also the Power switch was defective, and I could not get a replacement. so what I did was replace the volume control with another one and and added a power switch. Now it works like a charm.\n",
            "316 Hey actually this wasn't what I expected. I expected a cheap case. This is a well made sturdy case for a great price. It did smell horrible lol. But it also came with rack screws AND washers.\n",
            "317 It works, for the price, for what it is. I needed a gig bag, at about 25 dollars in a hurry, for carrying my carry around bass around town- in/ out car, hanging out at coffee shops, walking around place to place. If I had about 50 dollars I would have bought the next model up, the G4 or whatever, with more padding, but I didn't, and this one is doing the job just fine. I have a Precision Bass copy (an Epiphone Accu-Bass, hence the weird headstock) , and it fits in the bag.  The bag is protective enough and seems durable enough for the purpose of carrying the bass around town. The pocket won't hold much- just strings and some music, but the bag does carry the bass.\n",
            "318 Love the sound. Usually get controlled sound emperor. Nice change up.\n",
            "319 This is very light yet very durable and protective. I have a Squier Strat and it fits perfectly. It won't fit the guitar with the strap on, but I never do that anyways. The pockets are big as well as the inside compartments. Enough room for a few pedels inside or a strap, cord, picks and other small accessories.\n",
            "320 I bought two kits for a total of six guitar stand/holders. I don't know why they're described as \"Acoustic\" holders, I'm them using them to hold a heavy Fender Precision bass, and other standard electric guitars. They're easy to install, but as others have written, do not use the fasteners that come in the kit. They are cheaply made and are unsafe. I simply stopped by Walmart and picked up a couple packs of self-drilling drywall anchors (pictured). They're inexpensive fasteners and helped make the installation a breeze. I was able to install all six guitar stands in about 30 minutes.\n",

It's small and squishable, perfect for on-the-go audio recording. It comes in different colors so you can pick the one you prefer (I like black). If you accidentally get makeup on it, you can wash it right out (gently; like a favorite cosmetic sponge).\n",

            "325 Great strings,,, have that bright sound I love !!!!\n",
            "326 I've tried several other \"cheaper\" tuners and this is the one that is highly accurate. I even had them all connected at once and this one got the most precise readings. It's good for 6 string guitars but 7-8 strings may have more problems. The design is nice and the color is beautiful. It feels quite fragile since it's plastic so you have to be careful with it but it's cheap enough to replace without worry. Nice to have if you don't have a line in through tuner like the Korg pitch black.\n",
            "327 Hot damn!  I replaced the original neck position humbucker on my 1980 Les Paul (which I bought new) with a SPH90 Phat Cat.  What a difference!!  It is MUCH louder, and brighter, and all around sweeter and more tuneful that the original.  I used to rarely use the neck pickup alone.  Now I'll use it almost exclusively (though mixing in a bit of the bridge humbucker is sweet too).  I'm very glad I bought this and made the switch.  P.S. - I've had no problem with hum from this pickup - if you do, your problem is probably somewhere in your amp.\n",
            "328 The quality of the case is all metal\n",
            "329 It was exactly as I expected. Sounds great under all circumstances! Hot sound, without being harsh. Serious attitude. Serious attack. Sounds great clean also. All of this, without losing the guitar's natural voice. Installed it in a '78 Stratocaster, and gave it a new life. It's just too bad that it took me decades to finally take the plunge to switch from a Super D. (which had been my go to in all my guitars since the mid 80s).\n",
            "330 My application of this is to plug three guitars in to my pedalboard (see pics).  It is noiseless, and shows no tone-sucking qualities at all.  It runs well off a 9-volt or a Dunlop DC Brick, although that is just for the function of the lights.  It also works with no power at all (but the lights come in handy to know which selection is ON).\n",
            "331 A solid strap that I used on my Strat.  Very nice.  It's not flashy, which fits my style well.  Works well, solidly made.  No worries that the guitar is going to come off while playing.  I've taken some shots of the Poly Locks, check out the mechanism.  It's pretty nice.  Definitely will do what you want and last a good long while.\n",
            "332 This kick-pad is excellent. It additionally lowers the sound of your bass drum, so if you're not satisfied with the sound, this will help. It lasts very long and can take a beating of all kinds, whether you single pedal like Nirvana of double pedal like All That Remains. I highly suggest this kick-pad if you're looking for one that will last long and protect your bass drum from injury  =D\n",
            "333 It takes awhile to get used to using leather instead of the usual fabric strap. Fabric strap can be shifted freely on my shoulder however leather one has lots of friction and it has thicker width. I need to lift up the strap to adjust its position on my shoulder. This is made of synthetic\n",

I was not surprised at the smaller size of the Bowl but I was surprised by the excellent quality and tone of this Singing Bowl. it is a true instrument that begs to be played.\n",
            "336 Way better than I was expecting.\n",
            "337 works nicely attached to my shelf poll below my piano for guitar mic\n",
            "338 A really cool way to decorate you bass or guitar.  Taking away one star because the hole was to small to fit over my bass.  I had to use a drill bit to make the hole slightly bigger, and that did the trick.  I image they will fit will over most bass or guitars.\n",
            "339 A lot of the reviews for this are divided. \"Oh, it sounds great,\" and \"sounds like a s***ty gong\" come to mind. I bought it anyways. It is definitely a cheap buy, and still looks like an amazing cymbal. As for sound, it does sound pretty crappy. But it's still a great buy for beginner drummers, or drummer who just like to jam out in their basements/garage. Once you start to get a gig or two, you should consider going with a better cymbal\n",
            "340 I've been using these windscreens for years on all kinds of mics, and so has the entertainment industry. They block out wind noise and plosives without affecting the sound of the mic, not to mention the square shape is more visually-appealing to use on a mic like a Beta 87C than a ball-shaped windscreen. Speaking of ball-shaped mics, you can even get these to work on those. The proof is as easy to find as turning on your TV in the morning--under the A85WS on Wayne Brady and Jonathan Mangum's mics on \"Let's Make A Deal\" is a Beta 58A cartridge.\n",
            "341 Very happy with this baritone ukulele. I have been wanting to try one since I also play guitar. There was a little buzzing but raising the bridge a tiny bit solved the problem. Also upgraded the tuners just because I had some nice silver ones on hand. .  The sound on this uke is wonderful. Can't go wrong with this beauty.\n",
            "342 I love D'Addario strings, however, this particular set when installed on my 28.625\" scale 8-string - the top .74 string was not wound far enough to reach the nut. This left me with roughly 1/3\" of the string that does not match (Pic). I'm honestly not sure if this is an isolated incident or if all packs will yield the same result. I will give them another try in hopes of a better set, but if this is the standard then D'Addario should really consider the extended scale of 8-string guitars and ensure the strings are wound far enough.\n",
            "343 Make sure to note the big old 'Xfinity' logo splashed across the front. This is fine for studio use, but the gigging musician should try to avoid giving away free advertising to the telecommunications giant and cover the logo with black tape.\n",
            "344 Installed these on a cheap, beat-up Juan Estruch classical guitar that I got at a flea market for $25.  It's a surprisingly nice guitar, but one of the tuners was bent, one was completely broken, and all were rusty.  I ordered these as a new replacement that would fix these problems without costing as much as the guitar itself did.\n",

            "355 This Gator guitar hanger is sturdy, attractive, and easy to install.  It comes with wall anchors for drywall, and long screws.  The hangers are rubber coated to prevent finish damage.  The instructions are simple and I had this installed in under 5 minutes.  There are no screws visible once the unit is on the wall.  I was initially worried that the guitar would hang too close to the wall, however it is a good 3.5\" away.  It did take some \"oomph\" to get the actual hanger prongs parallel to the floor, but it certainly feels solidly locked in.  I was fortunate enough to have a location where a stud was available (and I would highly recommend using a stud for the install), however 2 heavy duty screw-in wall anchors also come with the unit for drywall mounting.  I much prefer this clean look to having the guitar on a floor stand in the corner where it tends to gather dust and dog hair. Ugh.\n",

            "357 Awesome quality for the price. I did replace the foam protecting covers with thick rubber, but that's more personal preference than a quality issue. The price for this stand is outstanding. I bought two more, and now have three in all. I keep one at my practice space as well. These stands are completely trustworthy with any standard guitar styles. A flying V, or Dimebag Model, or even an Explorer may not work with these. I am quite satisfied with mine.\n",
            "358 Great tuner. I use it for my guitar and also with vocals. Clips to the end of the guitar for easy use. It has lasted years. I've replaced the batteries a few times, but mostly because I forget to turn it off from time to time. Great item.\n",

Playing it through my Peavey TNT 100 bass amp I place it on the lower belly under the strings with the jack on the side secured by Velcro. I use industrial strength Velcro. I may place it lower with the wire hidden beneath. It gives me the top end and the bottom. I highly recommend it. Although it is durable, I'm going to buy two more.

The Musicman Ray34 bass was being considered because of the price and the reviews. I've been playing bass for over 40 years and had never even picked up a Music Man bass before. I ordered one that had been returned so it was sold as used, it was sent through the APO mail system (which I really appreciate with Amazon), but could not find a mark or smudge on it.  It was as new as it could be. Much to my surprise, it was also \"IN TUNE\". It was setup perfectly. I have played it here for a couple of months with some friends and they are amazed on how good it sounds. I have always been a Fender man but this is now my favorite bass. Thanks again for supporting the Military APO/FPO mail system.\n",

When I opened it up, it didn't even come in it's own box. It's box was just the shipping box. Immediately after taking it out of the box, I heard this rattle as if something was loose inside and it fell through the entire keyboard  like a rain stick. I checked out all of the keys individually and they all worked except for a C# on the lowest octave.\n",
            "382 I was afraid to order this after reading so many bad reviews about holes not lining up. So I have to weigh in and say that it fits my 1994 Black Label Fender P-Bass perfectly. It was a tight fit, but after some wiggling and strategic pressing around the pickups, it finally sat down. My original pickguard was an off white (originally white, but it aged), on a cream/off white body. I wasn't a fan of the look, so I got the Tortoise Shell color.

This works even if you don't have a stud where you want to put it, I just nail it to the wall, the white plastic things they included looked like they might make some big holes. It also looks good when the instrument isn't hanging on it. I have 3 now, they take about 4 or 5 days to arrive.\n",

            "387 Got the Super 55 Deluxe for my wife to use when rehearsing in home studio. She was using a $100 Sennheiser E835 Dynamic Cardioid and *hated* it so I decided to fix that situation. With no change other than plugging in the Shure Super 55, adjust input trim on mixer and some minor EQ, the difference in her voice was remarkable. Very even and consistent response across vocal frequency range. Some presence enhancement,  subtle and helps vocals punch through mix. Another reviewer mentioned the Shure Super 55 may have some compression characteristics -- I agree and it's a good thing; she is able to get right up to the mic, soft or screaming, it doesn't peg the meter (much) on my board. Another thing is that she *loves* the look of the Super 55 Deluxe; puts her in the mood for that 40's/50's jazz stuff she does so well :) Overall - we are very happy with the Super 55 Deluxe and I will probably get a second one for myself soon.\n",

She's been kind of luke warm ever since getting one but my middle daughter has been asking for one for a while now, so this was her birthday gift.  It's what you'd expect it to be....it's a Fender, but it's a Squier...so it's going to be mass produced \"alright\" quality for the most part, but not stellar by any means.  Nevertheless, it gets the job done (getting someone young interested in the learning process).  Be prepared to tighten down the various screws and nuts on the guitar when it arrives (this is why I docked them one star).  Personally I dislike strats, but this seemed like the best option to get my kids started on guitar.\n",

            "398 I bought the classical guitar case. It fits my Ruben Flores 1200 perfectly. I had my doubts for the low price. It's very solid constructed. It comes with two keys for a lockable latch. It has a nice surface texture that feels like leather. The whole thing feels really well-built.\n",
            "399 NOT as advertised.  They claim these are Rapco Horizon Cables, but they are actually Stagemaster - whoever that is.  Rapco Horizon cables offer a lifetime warranty and they LAST!!!  I have some that are just going bad after 14 years of weekly use.  This is a bait and switch - do NOT be deceived like I was.\n",
            "400 Great pickguard!  Used on my MIM strat project.  Purchased a black MIM body from amazon and this 3ply black with white border pickguard from musiclily.  Guitar looks awesome!  This is a very quality product.  Especially for the price.  My guitar body didn't have pickguard holes, so I had to drill them.  I just taped this pickguard down in place and drilled the holes.  I am really happy with the result!\n",

            "403 Perfect gauge for me. Easy to strum or pick with. Does not slip off my fingers easily. Previously I bought Fender's Medium picks, however they are too thin despite also labeled as Medium. I have also tried many other brands, but most of them are too slippery for me to grip on. These picks work best for me. Perhaps you should not choose color White like I do. It looks too plain and rather yellowish.\n",
            "404 Kit is awesome. I play in my garage just for personal enjoyment not for performances or anything. Once you take the time to break down all the settings, your able to dial in pretty much any kit and sound.

            "407 Never lose your pick again. This is an essential item in your repertoire of gadgets for guitar players. I tried this almost on every surface I could possibly stick it to, and every time it worked great (except on dry wall...). Needless to say, this is designed for guitars, so any guitar you have, you can stick it to. No adhesive, no tape, no mess. Just press, and there you have it. Check the pics. I love Ernie Ball products, and this is another winner. Patent pending, made in China.\n",

Note that the adjustment is by rotation of the arms to adapt to the neck size of your guitar.  The arms are padded to protect the finish on your guitar.\n",
            "413 First of all i would say that for the price, this is something you don't want to let pass. Dont be fooled for the size, these lights are just more than bright. I had some problems with one light out of 4, but customer service was able to help me asap. DMX controls, they work amazing. I would highly recommend these lights to anybody.  In the picture i added i have just one of them lights in purple, wich i used on for the floor.\n",
            "414 Has a great sound to it, a really wonderful tone. I would highly recommend it over any other phaser in the same price range and maybe double its price range, nothing can touch it in terms of its sonic quality, and it's a great bargain for the money. No hum and coloring of tone. Built like a tank and has a small foot print on your board. Sounds very close to the MXR Phase 90, just a bit more suttle and a lot smaller. I was a little worried after I ordered the pedal. Being used to a Mutron Bi-Phase, I didn't know how the Donner would perform. BOY, was I surprised. Not only could I get that Van Halen phase sound, I also got a great classic Alabama, Waylon sound too. It is built rugged and simple. Who could ask for more.\n",

It's very well-made with really good quality zippers and construction, with roomy front and side pouches I haven't even used yet. :) The bag comes with 10 dividers (I only used 8...description says it comes with 8, but I'm pretty sure I got 10) which can be repositioned with velcro (probably much neater than I've done here).\n",

I purchased 2 CBI cables and received them within the appropriate time line and they were well packed. However, as you will see in the photos below, one of the cables was absolutely a terrible cable to send out. The connectors were covered in some sort of sticky mess and the Phillips screw was completely stripped out on of the connectors. Terrible terrible experience for me. I will attempt to return this cable and receive another from the company.\n",

I have two beautiful Dixon Hummingbirds, and these are the only straps that are just as beautiful as my guitars. I loved the first one I bought so much that I bought two more.

My guitar guy says the same thing. I put Ernie Ball 9s on mine and it plays really good. I don't care where it's made nor what it costs, it is a great guitar for the money. Very solid build and save for a few rough fret edges it came in great shape. A tele with some distortion is one of life's great sounds IMO. Recommended. Cheers\n",
            "429 Love this cable! I bought a purple (red & blue knitted) one and a green one. Both look great, sound clean, and work fantastic. I only need to stand a few feet away from my amp, so I'm good with 10 feet. But wanted to point out its not super long. If you like to walk around....get a longer one.\n",
            "430 Overpriced. You should get a coupe dozen for this price. Buy some tubing at a home improvement store, drill holes in it, cut them apart and make your own. The tubing costs less than $.50/foot and you can make 10. I am an orchestra teacher and I've made thousands of these.\n",

            "432 First off this is NOT a leather strap. Only the ends are leather. I've owned this model in 3\" several times. I keep coming back because of the style. But the glue they use to piece the front and back together cannot stand sweat. So it separates pretty quickly, after about 4 uses. The sad thing is the strap is made quite well except for the plastic end that holds the nylon strap part to it. If it breaks, your $2000 plus guitar takes a dive. Using strap locks, I would prefer if they used a metal part instead of the plastic part. But the separation is a real downer. All they would have to do is sew or use better glue. They must know this is a factory defect, but for many years now all my straps have done the same exact separation in the same exact place. Total I have purchased a dozen of these straps for my guitars.\n",

            "436 I saved my money for retirement, so I could afford a quality musical instrument. I did all my online research, and tested many guitars at music shops. Some felt like works of art, flashy, shiny, with that dipped in plastic look and feel. The Jim Dandy looked old style with jumbo fret markers, and a satin type finish...I thought it was old! I strummed a few chords and it played ok. I liked the short size and bought a back pack style case. I ride my bike two miles with my guitar every day to jam with friends at the Marina. This Gretsch Jim Dandy kicks mine and everyone that hears or plays it's butt! It stays in tune and the sound it puts out, tho not too loud, is pure nostalgia at it's finest! She cries the blues, yet if you finger pick a happy tune, you can't stop from smiling. This may not be an expensive instrument, but it's a true classic.\n",
            "437 im not sure why this stand only gets a 3star rating.it took less than 10 minutes to put together and works great.ive attached a pick.id buy another.\n",
            "438 I have owned two Martins over the years. I have been playing only electric guitars the last many years. I came across some old songs I wrote for the acoustic guitar. I tested several guitars because I wanted a nice kick back acoustic that covered all the base and mids I remember from the Martin coffee house days. I did not like the new guitars, they did not sound the way I remember them. I walked out of my favorite music stores with out any guitar. My friend told me to try a Canadian made guitar a Seagull. I never heard of them. I saw a few for sale used, that's good because I wanted an old one. I tested a 1996 S6 Seagull and the sound, power and tone from this guitar was fantastic. I bought it, set the action very low and put some #9 strings one it. This cedar top has a magic to it and I am pleased with this one. Just as fine to play as the crazy priced guitars.\n",
            "439 This is a practical and versatile instrument tuner. It includes a metronome and tone generator and a variety of settings. The clamp attaches easily to an instrument and the tuner can rotate to the angle that is convenient for seeing it. The power and function buttons are easy to use. This does have a few limitations, such as the frequency range limit of 435-445 hz. The meter shows you if you are flat or sharp or right on the note, and this is a precise tuner - you won't get the green light if you are slightly off. I have tried multiple tuners and this one is good, with the extra features that make it a great value and go to accessory for musicians. I received a sample at no cost for my honest, unbiased review.\n",
            "440 Great quality mount and price. The inner clamp is padded which prevents scratches. However, no adapter in package. Though you won't need one for most standard threads. Still, an adapter would have been nice for smaller threads.\n",

            "444 This product so far has been absolutely stunning. I believe that it most definitely CAN be used for professional soundtracks and music. But duh, FL Studio is for the super duper professionals, blah, blah, blah. I use it for my YouTube channel it's been nothing but wonders for me! It's funny because when I first received the item, I SUCKED at doing anything on this software. Then, five days later of experience and watching about two videos on this, I felt like a confident pro! If you're frustrated at first with the software then don't fret. You're not the only one, and you'll get the hang of it.\n",
            "445 OMG! This is perfect ! I was hesitant to go drilling a hole in my Ukelele but wanted to have the option of amplification. This fit the bill with easy quick insallation ! No miss no fuss and it produces great ,clear wonderful sounds . I placed the pads in a triangular formation from the bridge down to the sound hole. I did take a tip from someone and got glued the solder joints on the piezos for added protection. 30 minutes total install time and that's cuz I have big club hands lol  . This is a true bargain quality piece comparable to the KK mini but about 80.00 $ cheaper .  In fact I used the KK installation video online to do the job . Highly recommended !\n",
            "446 Great item, I installed it with no problems, I ordered together with the Shure A26X 3 Inch extension,following the recommendations of one reviewer here on Amazon, I'm glad I did, my Keyboard it's the Yamaha PSR S900, which has built in speakers and makes the keyboard \"thicker/Higher\" than a regular keyboard so the extension it's definitely needed. I also order the OnStage Boom stand arm, everything works great I also ordered[To arrive Thursday] the quick clip extension just to make it easier to remove.\n",

            "449 It's really flexible on how you're planning to put on top of it. The only small con is the top surface, you might wanna get a cheap Ikea board for it so you can throw anything. I put my guitar amp head (around 40lbs I think), and two monitor speakers without a problem. Love it!\n",

My friends have other systems and they all have a chord leading to a small pack they wear on their hip. I didn't want the added \"baggage' to carry as I also have in ear monitors that have said \"baggage\". This thing performs through my entire house and on stage. It's a wonderful edition to my gear most definitely CHARGE PLUG AND PLAY. You will not regret it!\n",
            "452 Bought this for the brass tip, didn't need the rest. Just wanted to beef up my Zakk Wylde Les Paul Custom Plus to make all the gold hardware match. Does the job perfectly!! But be warned: the added weight of the metal gives the switch a much heavier and thicker clicking sound when switching from pup positions. It doesnt bother me because I play metal and this sound doesnt come through the amp. But for you clean players, this heavy clunk might be audible through your amp. However, I would still give it a shot and see if you like it and can even hear it because it looks great and everyone hears their music differently! And I actually like the added chunky feel. Makes my Grail feel just a bit more tough!\n",
            "453 I purchased these for my oldest son. He plays multiple instruments and had talked about wanting some thumbpicks for his acoustic guitar. I'd much rather purchase items to enhance his musical abilities than video games any day!\n",
            "454 I purchased this from a different store with a gift card. It lasted less than 10 string changes. The design could be easily remedied by using a metal shaft instead of a piece of plastic. After it broke, it took about 10 minutes for me to drill the hole out a little and then put a screw in there. Works fine now. If you are up for purchasing a thing that's going to last a few times and then spend a little time fixing it, then this is your product!\n",
            "455 This was a excellent purchase ! I struggled to find a stand that would allow me to use my bass pedals with my keyboards. I just couldn't find a stand wide enough . This stand was absolutely perfect ! Good heavy duty construction. Quality product !\n",
            "456 Cuts strings perfectly....had no problems even with very light gauged strings...4 instead of 5 stars because it stays open, however, it was easily fixed by simply using a rubber band.\n",
            "457 This is a nice stand, but it doesn't work great for my concert-sized ukulele.  It's definitely durable and adjustable, but it's a little too large for my instrument.  I have tried to pull the legs of the stand closer together in order to better accommodate the size of my ukulele, but in doing that, it feels a bit unstable.  If you're looking for a compact, inexpensive stand, I would definitely recommend this one, but just be aware that it might not work as well for smaller instruments.\n",
            "458 I needed a smaller pedalboard for my solo setup and considered building one. When I saw the price on this one I decided to try it. Awesome. I fit a large amp pedal, EQ pedal, loop pedal, loop controller pedal and surge protector on this bad boy with room to spare. Well made and packs up compactly. Before you break out the plywood and Velcro give this pedalboard a go.\n",
            "459 Having a blast!  Never played before today. Took abou an hour and a half to put together. Had to use a LARGE slotted screw driver to ease the clamps open to accept posts with a bit of a twist of the screw driver; once in, they slid all the way in with a bit of help with a few taps of a rubber mallet.  Now it's all together and very snug. Other than that it was an easy paint-by-number set up. The initial sound is great. I'll have to tweak cymbal #3 - (ride) it seems a bit quiet when I hit it. But hitting the button on the head comes out full and loud. So I'll figure that out eventually. Of course that only happens on some of the different kits to choose from. Anyway, from a tenor saxophonist's first time on a full drum set, this is fantastic!\n",

Footrests didn't work well for my practice space and somewhat longer-than-average torso, and I always felt my right leg had to be too far outward. I thought this product was a bit expensive at first for what it is - metal and velcro - but it solved everything for me.\n",

            "465 Question:  Are you better off with a hard case? The problem with ukes is that they can get squished.  Also, it's a soprano ukulele!! How much can a hard case weigh?  If you have a hard case, you can throw it in the trunk of your car, pile things on top of it...\n",
            "466 Pretty difficult for Boss to mess this up. Molded plastic box with plastic hinges and space for three pedals (see photos).

I wanted to find something mobile, easy to set-up & affordable. After reading reviews, it was a no brainer so I made the purchase. The stand is sturdy, light, portable & very easy to set-up. I have my 20\" Sharp Aquos mounted on it (see pictures uploaded), and it took me less than five minutes to set up! The only complaint I have is the screws for the mic holders do not fit. They are a tad too big. Either the screws are too big or the holes were not made large enough. It's no big deal. I highly recommend this product. Buy it!!!\n",
            "468 This is a great case the only reason I didn't give it five stars is cause there is no place for the basic cables for the controller power chord and USB\n",

            "470 I now have eight of these.  I enjoy seeing my instruments, and feel confident they are safely off the floor away from little monsters.  I didn't understand they came in different woods so they don't all match.  No matter, they still work well.  I wasn't real sure about the mounting screws that came with them.  However, they have been up a couple of years and no problem at all.  Note, I am not hanging mandolins which are a bit heavier.  I have tenor and soprano ukuleles.  Second note: the cushioned part that holds the instrument comes in different sizes, the narrow size is the one you need for thru tuners.\n",
            "471 Great little mouthpiece sleeve that fits my Otto Link hard rubber tenor sax mouthpiece near-perfectly!\n",
            "472 Adds a nice touch of originality. I paired these with a Fender tweed strap, but maybe it is a little bit of overkill having the F sign everywhere (\"Ok ok we KNOW it is a Fender, come on!\"). They are kind of massive when installed, doesn't look bad but just bulky. Only problem I had is that I had previously installed a set of Dunlop straplocks, and when substituting them for these, the new Fender screw fell kind of short, and never got tight, they always stayed turning around when screwing them. So I had to use the previous Dunlop screws with the new Fender ones, and it worked like a charm. Not a problem of the product, but if one has used something else before, one might have these kinds of issues later. Not as easy to lock into the guitar as other models, this one requires two fingers to adjust, instead of for instance Dunlops, with just a central button. Just be sure that your guitar is strapped when you let it go!\n",
            "473 At first I hesitated because $30 seemed a lot for a mic stand but I decided to just keep the order. It came in about 4 days immediately and I set it up. Wow the quality is amazing. It extends pretty high and far. I was worried at first it would be too small but it soon proved me wrong. There are no flaws. I will definitely order another one soon for my second mic. This product was great and there's a reason this was rated 5 Stars. Great for home studio budgets. Highly recommend!\n",
            "474 100% satisfied. After scraping off the nasty blobs of gunk, a few small drops of this (and some rubbing) restored an almost unusable 30 year old rosewood fretboard. If only it could add some metal to the worn frets...\n",
            "475 For a cheap, off-brand instrument, it plays excellently and resonates very well. The bass feels very sturdy and looks fantastic in person. It definitely needs better strings, but what new instrument doesn't? I haven't tried amplifying it, and I honestly don't plan to, as I only wanted it for the acoustic properties to practice without having to drape myself in cables. The neck is comfortable, the body is well-assembled, and having two strap buttons opposed to the usual single one on most acoustic basses is a welcome feature. The bridge is also very nice: the last acoustic I had, I kept losing bridge pins, so not having to deal with those was a main drawing point for this bass for me.\n",
            "476 Looks great on my sons fender acustic!  Was easy to put on\n",
            "477 This is a great well made pedal board for my home needs. Really well made and the power cord and carry bag for the price is a bonus, all I needed was some 6\" patch cords and attach the included Velcro and good to go.\n",
            "478 I like it.  It fits my cutaway guitar no problemo.  Not sure why others had trouble with it...\n",
            "479 I love these. They look awesome and the oblong shape really helps keep the strap on. I did have to use my previous screws because the ones they came with were just a bit too small. I don't mind the black screws since my new knobs are black and gold.\n",
            "480 I have nothing bad to say about this stand. It works and it gets the job done. I use it at home,  and I have placed it in a corner of the room with 3 electric guitars, one acoustic, and one bass.\n",
            "481 I have been slowly replacing all of the hardware on my old harmony stratocaster with Fender parts. These had a huge impact as my guitar now stays in tune. Excellent price to quality ratio. Would recommend to a friend.  Looks great as well.\n",
            "482 These cables are perfect for pedalboards that need a little more reach than average. They aren't as cheap looking as other budget cables.\n",
            "483 This foam windscreens are a little bit smaller than I had hoped. They will fit most microphones, but unfortunately my Blue Yeti is too large to comfortably fit these covers on. Even after stretching the foam and muscling it on, the foam still leaves a bit of the microphone's mesh uncovered. I'll attach some photos of how these windscreens fit different types of microphones.\n",
            "484 I've been playing ProMark 747s for decades....  because my wife likes Porcupine Tree and Gavin Harrison (so do I), she surprised me with a pair of these and I was blown away.  Great grip and great feel.  I've never played with grippy anything but I sure do love it.  I did finally break the pair after some time and it's time for a new pair....  I just with I could roll them on a flat surface to be sure they're STRAIGHT and not warped which I've been bitten by before with online stick purchases.  Here they were before breakage.\n",
            "485 Great light, bright for its size\n",
            "486 Top quality multi ply material...I made double pickguards for my Everly Brothers  J 180 ...had just enough material...it came out awesome...looks awesome...you be the judge\n",
            "487 Impressive brightness, 30 beam angle, and fixture is well-built. Saving static colors was tricky at first, but the vendor was more than helpful with tech support. Once your color is set manually, if you press setup again after setting the color you wanted, you will have the same color next time you power it back up. Overall, impressed considering the cost and brightness. Flawless DMX control!\n",
            "488 This microphone bundle was more than worth the price. The sound quality is excellent. The setup is relatively easy. I use it with a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 which already has phantom power built in. Put the gain at about halfway and it was good to go. Very pleased with it and will most likely be buying another one soon to add to my home recording studio.\n",
            "489 I've been playing for 9 years and was worried this won't be on par with the mid-end guitar I've been using. The guitar both looks and feels great. The finish is very well done. It's got a warm and full sound to it that I really enjoyed, that at times I found myself reluctant to stop playing. And I was really pleased with how smooth the fretting was, it felt like it took less effort to move between the frets and press down than on several guitars I've played on previously.\n",
            "490 Pickguard was a perfect fit for my Squier bass partscaster. It fit all pickup and screw holes dead on. Very happy.\n",
            "491 Quality is questionable; had to glue brackets that the bridge screw into which raise and lower the bridge to the guitar body. Brackets were not properly set and had fallen out of the guitar during shipping. Some of the guitar strings were broken; it's fun to glue and restring a brand new guitar. Since the repairs the guitar is playing well and sounds ok; no string buzz or anything no thanks to Schecter or Amazons questionable shipping practices...\n",
            "492 Just installed my new pick guard and trem cover.  Looks great and fits perfectly on my Squier Classic Vibe Strat.  The only problem is that a Classic Vibe Strat comes with an 8-hole pick guard, and this one has 11 holes.  Good thing is that the 8 existing holes lined up with 8 holes in the pick guard, and I had to drill the remaining three holes.  But since the pick guard was installed already I knew exactly where to drill them.\n",
            "493 It's may best solid state amps I ever had. Very versatile just one cons I can tell be aware when or need to use external pedals need optimization for work as you intended. It's very tricky (remember it's a modeler amp take this in consideration). But for a Stan-alone application it's the best. Have anything you'll need. Just connect your guitar and start playing as that easy.\n",
            "494 Amazing Fuzz pedal really good sound specially when you mixed with Baby Cry Wah and Tube Blackstar amp.\n",
            "495 these are 7\" tall at the microphone, doesn't matter how you have the legs 7\" is how tall they are.\n",
            "496 I got this for my son for Christmas and he really loves it.  He also as a condenser mic that needs phantom power in order to work.  With this focusrite scarlett 2i2 Audio Interface that eliminates that requirement as it also doubles as phantom power.  The mic is very clear when using this recording device.  He uses the Magix Music Maker to record his music.  It is excellent and he has not had any issues with it at all.  I asked him if there was anything negative about it and he said all he can think of is how perfect it is.  You can adjuster mic volume, very clear, he has not heard any cut outs.  The only con is if you leave it plugged in to the USB when you are not using it your voice will sound static, but he said its an easy fix you just unplug the USB and plug it back in.  By the way he is using an old dell laptop and it works great.\n",
            "497 I wanted to wait a few days and give this guitar some time before I reviewed it. I currently own 2 other Dean guitars including a 12 string and I wanted to say that I bought this guitar based upon the reviews here on Amazon which I most often do. I have to admit I really like Dean humbuckers. This guitar did not disappoint.  It is beautiful, and that shiny chrome-like green neck with silver fret bars is awesome.  This guitar is VERY playable--fits well in my hands and has nice low action. I really like the sound it puts out and it DOES stay in tune contrary to the negative comments I read to the contrary.  I really like these tuners because they a precise. It sounds awesome through my Zoom G5 effects pedal. I agree with the reviewer who said 'buy it now'.  You won't  be sorry.  This is now my main squeeze especially for anything rock. I recorded 4 Iron Maiden songs with it.  Sweet!!!!!!!!  I love this guitar. I just love it.  I can't say that enough.\n",
            "498 Bought a bunch of this and it looks awesome. Sound dampening abilities are limited given it's only 1\". If you're not on a budget consider something like Auralex foam, but if you are a normal person without tons of money, this is just fine.\n",
            "499 Before I put this on my guitar I took off the stock pickguard and lined it up against this one to check the alignment -- it was a perfect match.  I couldn't be happier with how it looks on my Mexican Telecaster. Great deal for $10.\n",
            "500 This necks r just as good as a 4 hundred dollar fender reeck I have built 30 guitars usingthis  neck. They always r a perfect fit great to play on with great response and they have that classic Look. So for 40 bucks you can purchase a fine product for a forth of the same quality.\n",
            "501 I had tusq pins on my Alvarez that had become damaged over the years. Been looking at these for a while and figured I'd give them a try.\n",
            "502 Works wonderfully with my MXL 990 Ribbon Microphone! Feels sturdy, easy to adjust, and keeps the mic well in place! It may not absorb as much sound as some specialty shockmounts, but it works perfectly for what it is.\n",
            "503 Easy to install.  Heavy duty.  I mounted mine in a custom built angled top rack.\n",
            "504 What a great new preamp from Fishman the Platinum Stage. It so small fits in a guitar case.  It gets rid of the low mud tone. In guitar mode the bass is at 150Hz, theres a low cut switch for 30hz, 80Hz, and 160Hz.  The middle is from 200Hz-3.1kHz Q1.3 and treble is at 6kHz.  I like that this is battery powered so I can use it with the Bose S1 Pro and my guitars with LR Baggs or Fishman pickups.  On the Cordoba F7 Paco w Fishman Ellipse it sounds great.  Thanks Fishman #FishmanElectronics #Fishman\n",
            "505 ergonomics and useful.\n",
            "506 At last, a neck cradle that makes sense and has some actual thought put into its design. There's a real popular neck cradle that looks like a rabbit and has a nice leather covering. It's rather expensive and I see\n",
            "507 The cable came just as advertised, it was thick, well made and appealing to the sight and touch. Customer care was excellent and I haven't even used the cable yet. I'm positive it will Proform as good as the company has with its follow up on purchase. This is what anyone who shops hopes for in a company and it is rare in today's consumer goods climate. That you very much and from that I highly recommend this product to all customers seeking cables for there Pro gear. DJ Sinista 1 -Alwayz Mobile Productions.\n",
            "508 I love programming with this device and software. Being able to make lighting fixtures and controls that work is amazing.\n",
            "509 Great Unit./....good price....and works well\n",
            "510 Haven't had a chance to really use them other than playing with them for a little bit just to check them out. I'm impressed by the colors, and the wide variety of choices. The price is not bad at all!\n",
            "511 UPDATE THE CONTROLLER BROKE AGAIN. MIC KNOB BROKE THEN THE LEVEL KBOB BROKE\n",
            "512 The first unit I got had a problem with noise on the line and a cyclic distortion. It turns out that the LM chip was overheating and defective. I received a replacement unit, and it works well. There is only a very slight amount of added static now, compared to my other preamp.\n",
            "513 Love this product. I just got it today and it sound perfect. I was skeptical that it would work, but its a Vox product so I figured I would be safe. So awesome to be able to practice without disturbing neighbors and family.\n",
            "514 Perfect fit for 2001 Mexican Standard Telecaster.  Two protective layers of plastic coating.  Looks great!\n",
            "515 I rewired my les paul good stuff!\n",
            "516 A slick pick holder with a small footprint. It sticks with suction -- just press down and it adheres. It pops on and off without damaging the guitar finish so it can be switched between guitars and placed wherever most advantageous for the player. It disengages with ease for storage and/or transport. I switched out a thinner pick in place of the one included and the device gripped it tightly. Ingenious gadget and modestly priced.\n",
            "517 These were a perfect fit for my pedal board. No hum, no crackling, good solid connections.\n",
            "518 Worked for about a week the the weight of the guitar pulled the sheetrock anchor out of the wall and left a huge hole now. It needs to come with better anchors.\n",
            "519 I have a Gibson Les Paul Standard from 2013 with burstbucker pros.  Supposedly the burstbucker pro is wound to sound like the original PAF (how they actually sounded), while the Classic 57 is wound to the original design specification of PAFs (how they were supposed to be made). I just picked up a gorgeous Gibson ES-335 from 2001 with the Classic 57, and man, I like this way better than the burstbucker pro!  Both are great pickups, but these have such great bite in the lead and smooth in neck I can stop listening to it.  Every note rings so nicely.  Between the 2 pickups I can find great jazzy/bluesy tones and some to just rock out!  I can't say enough about it, except I'm really neglecting my chores with all the time I'm spending now enjoying these!\n",
            "520 Sounds better thank my 400. AE Ibanez. First two had defects not major. First sounded great . And the one I have now great too. I would buy again! Great guitar for experienced players and beginers alike. Hope this helps.\n",
            "521 Not bad for the price.  Worked great for my BC Rich retro makeover.\n",
            "522 New fave strings for my Fender Jaguar & Jazzmaster! It gives my offsets extra balls. Unlike many flats which tend to sound dull/plucky and higher tension, these would still give you enough brightness and liveliness with a surprisingly balanced sound throughout all strings. It will be tuned fast and stays in tuned for weeks, they only need VERY minor tuning every now and then. Even the wounded G doesn't bother me, it's pretty subtle you almost wouldn't feel it. It's actually CHEAP considering how long these strings would last.\n",
            "523 Unfortunately this switch creates a large pop when switch on or off. For a DJ or game announcer it is entirely unacceptable to have a big pop every time the mic mutes or un-mutes. It would have only added a very small margin to have done this right. The engineer in me wanted to take it apart and add a resister and cap to fix the problem. I chose to return it.\n",
            "524 Does not fit all guitars but it's cheap so no complaints really makes my band setup appear more professional.\n",
            "525 Hello guys, I'm very disappointed with my purchase... I throw up money with poor plastic. I opened the stick and \"easily\" broke very low quality plastic!! U can see attached photo.\n",
            "526 Look good product, design is great but one thing when we record with impact app it the same sound (pluged and unplugged) not different until you connect with guitarcable.\n",
            "527 This board serves the purpose, and if you know what you're doing it is endlessly customizable.  Just got it today, but I have bg plans for making it work for me. As a good platform for pedals, it's pretty solid.\n",
            "528 Easy to use, clear sound, doesn't compromise your pedal board space. Perfect for me!!\n",
            "529 I got this to replace the bridge pickup on my squire strat. I was skeptical that it would really make much difference, but my feedback problem was solved, and the tone is much warmer and cleaner (the old pickup was just awful). I read comments saying that the green wire goes with the red and the white is hot. Mine came with the red wire as hot, and I didn't change that. It works, and it definitely sounds like a beige pickup is supposed to, so it think you should just trust whatever setup the factory gives you. Also, I know other people explained this, but many said they had to enlarge the pickup hole to accommodate the pickup. You DO NOT. It takes a bit of patience but if you are careful, you can slip it in with no modifications.if you are looking to upgrade a cheap guitar, you should be pretty well satisfied with this pickup.\n",
            "530 I put these knobs on my squire strat, my epi sg, and an off brand strat. They all fit easily enough (a bit snug but I prefer that). They are very heavy and solid feeling. Ive had them on the guitar pictured since I got them a few months ago and I haven't had any problems. I did kind of dent the inside of a gold one as I put it on my squire, so you do have to be careful when installing. Also, as people have said, the black knobs have no hole in the chin to tighten or loosen. As far as I can tell, this is about the best value you can get for these style knobs, and I do not think you will be disappointed with them.\n",
            "531 Best tone I've ever played... Personally, this pedal played with my mustang V solid state amp just make it sound unbelievably good... Every not I feel it so delicate, et powerful. This pedal is very subtle in it's effect, but for those with an ear to listen can tell the amazing rich tone this pedal produces. Please connect it on the FX send return channels of your amp, otherwise if placed in front the pre amp of the pedal will create a little noise...\n",
            "532 After a string change the tips next to the end started chipping away.\n",
            "533 I have a 1950s Fender tweed amp, so I wanted to get this strap to match it. It is a perfect match! The leather on the ends is a bit lighter than in the product picture, but it's fine. I love that the stripe is Fender tweed, which any musician should recognize. It's not garish -- it's a subtle statement. The feel of the fabric is nice, and it isn't too stiff like some straps are. All in all, it was a good purchase.\n",
            "534 I have never used AKG microphones before. I decided to take a chance on this from all the great reviews. They were right! I used this to record a Taylor 914CE, the sound was chrisp, great mid and just enough low to not overpower the sound. I totally recommend this for vocals and acoustic guitar recording!\n",
            "535 It's great bass rosin. I have tried Pop's, Nyman, and Kolstein. I like Pop's and Kolstein the best. Pop's (when fresh) is the stickiest. Nyman is hard and powdery. Kolstein is very sticky and there is almost no powder at all. There is something special in their formulation. I believe Kolstein includes wax in their rosin recipe, which keeps dust from forming. The other benefit of Kolstein is that it lasts for a very long time on the shelf. Pop's will dry out in less than 2 years. Some people will only use Pop's for a few months before throwing it away. I go back and forth between Kolstein and Pop's. I still can't decide which is my favorite. But them both and try it out.\n",
            "536 So far so good. Never heard of Lazarro and who cares? The saxophone can perform. The brand doesn't matter. It is just a label. I'm on month 5 and it is holding up. Play it everyday. Upgraded the mouthpiece to a Clark Forbes Debut mouthpiece. The reeds that the sax comes with isn't that great. Mine came with Lazarro reeds 2 1/2 strength and now I use D'Addario Select Jazz reeds 3S and it does the trick.  If you know how to take care of the saxophone it'll last. Well worth the investment. This is the perfect saxophone for those looking for a great instrument without paying hundreds to thousands of dollars.\n",
            "537 I first considered the Cordoba concert ukulele because it was on every list of the best beginner ukes, and I am so happy with my choice! It took about a week to stretch the strings and stay in tune, but the Cordoba sounds amazing. My daughter has a cheaper soprano uke and the Cordoba has a noticeably clearer sound and is much lighter weight. It just feels great in my hands. I tried some no-drill straps, but ultimately chose to add a strap button with no problem. I saw some reviews about quality control issues on the finish, and I did find a rough spot on the back (see photo). This was not an issue for me, but I'd suggest checking for this. Otherwise, I love everything about my Cordoba ukulele and highly recommend it for beginners. From my experience so far, it's worth spending a little more to get a quality instrument.\n",
            "538 Bought a 3 pack. Liked em so much I bought three more.\n",
            "539 these things are cheapo plastic.  i was very disappointed with the flimsy feel.  i added a photo of my Audio Technica 2020 loaded in one of these cheapo mounts.  the description said metal construction. it is not.  beware of this thing.  the more I look at it the sadder I get.  junk.\n",
            "540 I played a wedding today using the Alaska picks on my thumb and ring finger.  They were very comfortable and stayed on my finger well without being to tight.  For my fingers I cut the extra piece off and just used the smaller part.  It fits snug under my nail and is the perfect length. For my thumb I used the full size of the pick and it worked great.  The material is easy to bend and shape using a file and buffing blocks.  This produces a naturally smooth sound that you can get with your nails.  I got the medium size. They fit great on all my fingers but I might try the larger version for my thumb but the medium works great if you bend the plastic back and it makes it looser around the thumb.\n",
            "541 Great product and price. I bought these panels for a home studio, mostly for mixing a tracking as I don't do much live recording there. There is definitely a difference and the early reflections from the monitors are lessened (to my ears anyway). They did the job I needed and they look good too! I opted to pin them to the wall with t-pins instead of using adhesive. For my use it works well and I can remove them with little or no damage to the wall. I ordered a second box to put in a pattern on the one remain wall that could use some treatment.\n",
            "542 I changed the pickguard on my MIM Tele to add a little bit of snap to it...white pickguards are a little dull...also changed the volume & tone knobs to match the finish...EZ upgrades on both...\n",
            "543 Superb feel and sound!\n",
            "544 This is a fine EQ.  It sounds good and I'm  thinking of getting another one  for right and left  speaker.\n",
            "545 Absolute BEST guitar hangers on the market... You will not beat this price! Buy them while you still can for this cheap\n",
            "546 Works as discribed. looks awesome.\n",
            "547 Not very thick, but it works and looks good!\n",
            "548 It seriously sounds better than it has any right to at this price range, and I love it.  Great if you want to do some recording in an area that is not sound treated that you can't get away with using a condenser microphone in.  It has a lot of character as it's frequency response is far from flat.  Attenuation of the lows and a pretty beefy boost in the presence without going too bright.  It's a bit louder that the Shure sm58, but not hugely.  Still needs quite a bit of preamp, about 70% up on my preamp to remain in unity on my mixer for reasonable recording levels.  It's got a good sound to it.  I think it's super short sighted of Behringer to fail to include the frequency profile of this microphone on the Amazon store page, but don't worry I've got you all covered.  The picture attached is a document included with my microphone which SHOULD have been on this store page, and will give you an idea of what this microphone will sound like.\n",
            "549 I really wanted this pedal to work out for me but I am really disappointed in the external footswitch. So I am giving it one star so others are made aware of error in owners manual.\n",
            "550 This pickguard is wonderful, didn't have to mod it in any way, and I was concerned because the old one on the guitar is bigger then this one.  Thought I would have some visible holes on the guitar but nope it fit like a glove. Now I have a great looking guitar, oh let's don't forget the price.  Very low price, awesome product came with screws most don't so why buy a name brand at 5 times the cost.\n",
            "551 Simple to install and it works. I have an old Ibanez RG that I just didn't want to fuss with as far as tuning adjustments. Installed this with an extra spring and really tightened up the claw into the body, works as advertised. The coolest part is how you can set your bridge height before the final claw adjustment. Can still dive if I want but I'm just having fun playing the RG again in alternative tuning. I can go from 1/2 step down Van Halen right back up to standard leads w/o having to access the cavity. I may get a Tremol-no for my American Strat as I feel this is too limiting for a more expensive guitar.\n",
            "552 Great nylon strings, just as expected. They worked just fine on my daughter's mini classical guitar. They are as good quality wise as much more expensive strings I've purchased in the past. They are much softer to the touch and easier for her to learn on than my steel strings on my acoustic guitar. They came labeled with both the note name and the string number, which made putting them on easy and quick.\n",
            "553 Well... I guess the truth is this product is not for everyone.\n",
            "554 I actually picked up this bass at my local guitar center used, for $60! I brought it home, wiped it down with some dunlop guitar polish, cleaned and treated the fretboard with lemon oil, and put on a D'Addario Light set of strings. I have $75 invested, and it plays amazing! I've played it through numerous cabs, and record with it. Very happy. Check through the used section at GC first if you don't mind a quick cleaning and restring to save you $125!\n",
            "555 These strings were reccomended to me by an acquaintance of mine during a bass clinic I attended recently.  I ordered them right away.. All i can say is WOW! Excellent tone. It really brightened up my sound. I had gotten used to muddy sounding strings.  I haven't noticed a sticky feeling like others have mentioned, mine are silky smooth. Great playability. Wasn't too concerned about color, But When I installed them on my Ferrari red Carvin LB 70, I fell in love with my bass all over again.  It looks stunning, and I get many comments about my bass now..Others have mentioned that the color wears off quickly, but I don't care, I'll used the color wear as a guage of when to change them..Then neon ones even glow brightly under a black light.  Bass players don't get much credit so why not give them a show and something to talk about.\n",
            "556 I am impressed with this pedal. It works quite well, especially with a guitar ran through it for key reference. We have used it for many different applications, and different styles, and it seems to work under most conditions. I really enjoy the variation you have at your disposal with this pedals settings. You can have 1 or 2 lines of harmony, and you can chose whether they are each higher or lower, and between a 3rd and a 5th or the root note. The ability to control those factors makes a world of difference. I would recommend checking out some of the demo review videos if you are interested in this pedal.\n",
            "557 I loved using this while producing videos with my Canon EOS 6D, but it didn't last long.  When I inserted the battery into the receiver, one of the battery contacts broke off.  Here are some pictures of the receiver mounted on my EOS 6D and a picture showing the broken contact wire.  The battery holder has a bad design because the contacts are weak wire loops and the battery fits very snug and puts a lot of pressure on these weak contacts.  Samson should update the battery holder design.  I still recommend this wonderful wireless system, just something to be aware of.\n",
            "558 I am wanting to replace the stock single coil neck pickup in my 2016 Squier Affinity with a humbucker. This should do just fine. The mounting screws match up perfectly. Cheers!\n",
            "559 Bought this case for a 650mm classical guitar. There is some spare room around the body of this guitar. In the picture attached, you can see a box of strings (3/4\"), fits in between the guitar and case, but with the lid closed, the guitar doesn't move around, it feels secure.\n",
            "560 Great microphone, I use it with my cheap/budget Behringer mixer, the sound is good and if I turn up the gain it will pick up everything in the room. It is great for recording acoustic guitar and vocals, don't start layering the vocals though, it starts to sound kind of weird.\n",
            "561 I was looking for an second inexpensive ukulele for traveling or camping.  To my surprise this is a wonderful ukulele!  Its light weight construction makes its tone warm, bright and rich.  The construction on the instrument is very high quality.  If your looking for a beautifully designed comfortable playing ukulele, look no more.  Even the etching on the body is very nice.  Luna makes a few other designs in this etched series.  So if you don't like this design there are others to choose from.  I would highly recommend Luna's Mahogany Mo's Concert Ukulele to anyone who wants a high quality ukulele without spending a lot of money. And it even comes with a nice soft Luna case.\n",
            "562 Great little pedal with tons of tone! For anyone having noise issues with this guy, put it in the front of your signal chain. It doesn't like sitting behind other gain pedals (very typical big muff trait) put a clean boost behind it and it really goes!\n",
            "563 I was a little skeptical about this case but I went for it. It's for my rented violin that I just picked up. I travel for a living and looking for an alternative to the hard case the violin came in. This one is made of very high quality material, super light, and quality seems great. Fits the 4/4 like a glove and there's room for two bows, rosin compartment and an outer pouch that fits my shoulder rest. Comes with two straps that can make the case be used as a backpack, also came with the cloth to put on top of violin. Love it love it!\n",
            "564 Very easy to put on and looks very realistic and are worth every penny I highly suggest if you want to make your Epiphone look like a Gibson guitar\n",
            "565 I am building a recording studio. Every studio I've been to; you always expect a humongous mixer, a mac, very expensive condenser mic, and black mic cables. I wanted something unique and different. The connectors are sold and very nice! Cable is thick and sturdy. When I bend the cable I don't feel wires moving around inside. Very well made! You will like these cables!\n",
            "566 So far so good. These speakers have a great flat sound for audio MIXING and MASTERING. They can get louder than I thought from the reviews I've read. I'm in a full basement and these are perfect.\n",
            "567 Perfect- the blue is outstanding. Had it customized. Take a close gander at this masterpiece\n",
            "568 Wow! This is a beautiful looking instrument, solidly made, with a nice rich and bright tone, and all for only 38 bucks! Worth every penny and more!\n",
            "569 Prior reviews describing concerns about the handle on this case are accurate.  I bought this case new from GC less than a year ago, have never had it out of my studio, and the handle molding over ball joint is crumbling and falling apart (see photo).  This is not due to abuse, climate or bad design ... it's junk plastic.  Too bad - the fit and finish of this case is perfect for my Gibson Les Paul R8 VOS. I love the design and light weight, but there's no way I'd risk carrying my guitar in it now.  The handle is going to fail at any moment.\n",
            "570 Great fun,and,if you get a Whammy pedal,and ANY BLOODY DELAY(echo pedal),this is cool! if you add more,and run it thru a big amp,AWESOME!\n",
            "571 This is a beautiful, sturdy and easy to install hardwood hanger. The set arrived in great condition with all necessary parts including a quality wall anchor, should you need some. To install this set you need a screwdriver and a drill. This is made in USA and the high quality shows. No funny smells, either.\n",
            "572 Love these Strap Locks.  Easy, fast installation, and they work perfectly.  Have purchased a number of them.  Highly recomemded.\n",
            "573 This is everything you want in a fuzz box.  Mid scoop, custom-dialed mid boost or additional cut, bass boost, noise gate, and a special attack knob to add in certain frequencies to give attack back to the muff sound, if desired.  EHX listened to a decade of online feedback on the NYC 3-knob Big Muff Pi and added every must-have addition into a single pedal.\n",
            "574 Just what inwas specting to keep my mobile recording studio on the go. Don't let the \"cable bag\" fool you, this bag can keep more than just cables and is pretty customizable.  I recommend using it with khanka bags to give extra protection even though the bag is sturdy enough but to keep equipment more in place nice and tight. I would've preffered buying the large size but for now im happy with this one. I would recommend this to a friend and would buy another one again!\n",
            "575 I was surprised when I discovered this mic delivers XLR quality recording. I originally bought it for recording sessions during travel but it stacks up well against a 2x as expensive Rhode XLR mic! I would definitely recommend this mic to anyone looking for a good USB mic.\n",
            "576 great durable case, just like what others have said. it comes with screws n some washers. simple easy to work with.\n",
            "577 Worked ok in a pinch as a last minute purchase.  All of my amp rack patch panels have Neutrik NL4MP connectors, as most of my speakers.  I have some monitors with 1/4\" inputs which I am swapping out with Neutrik NL4MPs.  So no more 1/4\"inputs and no more knock offs for me.  No I will NOT purchase this product again. (Photo shows 'my custom made' 12/4 cable connected to OEM cable connector and panel mount).\n",
            "578 It's perfect, although it's not the simplest of portable stands with its number of parts\n",
            "579 I have four of these I purchased at my local guitar shop didn't buy from amazon. They are the exact same cables however and I think they are far too stiff and rigid. Example you can see visible wrinkles and feel the tension work against you when plugging these into pedals. I mean quite a bit of resistance as in unnecessary amount. Durable yes and that's great but I'm running a pedalboard for guitars Not pullin trucks out of mud pits damn. They do sound okay but nothing special. Look pretty cool too but looks aren't what's getting it done. Overpriced in my opinion as are most fender cables. Not a huge fan and prefer lower profile pancake type patch cables mogami sounds better , easier to work with and the pedals can be kept much neater and closer to save space. That means room for \"more toys!\" Hooked a few pedals together off the board and took a couple pics so you can get an idea of the tension and overall in my opinion sloppy fit of these cables.\n",
            "580 This is not a sturdy stand. This is probably not suitable for a school band room. It is a lightweight, foldable and easily stashed stand that barely holds a three ring binder with 50 pages of fake tab. But it does manage to do this. That's all I wanted. I can keep it folded up and out of the way next to the couch and take it out when I need it. Hands down beats the previous music stand I was using: the floor.\n",
            "581 Excellent with CAD U37 Microphone\n",
            "582 Excellent 2 tier keyboard stand.  It did exactly what I needed it to do, if fact came out better than expected.  Hard to believe it's only $27.  See the before and after photos.\n",
            "583 I received this and a InnoGear Studio Recording Condenser Microphone in exchange for an honest review, and I have to say as a podcaster and host of a radio show that I am able to do online this works amazing well.\n",
            "584 I do like these strings! Are they the best? There are so many personal preferences. Have you ever asked a drummer what double bass drum pedal they like? It is all too subjective, but I can tell you I have so far liked the quality and feel of the Super Slinky Pink!\n",
            "585 I put one of these cheap ass pickups in a kit guitar I built, and it sounds amazing!! No noise at all, and nice clear clean sound, and perfectly crunchy with distortion. Yes!!\n",
            "586 This is the second one Ive purchased, and I have ZERO complaints! These are amazing for hanging guitars. (Ive even got a mini one for my ukulele!) I would recommend these to everyone!!!\n",
            "587 These are great little stands. They are perfect for a \"wherever you need it\" stand. I have one next to my PC studio,making the guitar I'm using closer than my regular 5 guitar stand across the room ,and the other next to my bed (so i always have a guitar handy before and after i sleep ). These are really an amazing value and they hold guitars secure enough for me not to worry about them falling over...Holds my classical acoustics, stratocasters, and jazz bass perfectly....\n",
            "588 This case is rigid yet lightweight. There seems to be plenty of padding (high density Styrofoam?).  In regards to the various sizes, I bought the \"Electric\" size and it fits my new Fender Strat perfectly.  A Fender Strat fits snugly without shifting around.  NOTE:  If you have a Les Paul style guitar, make sure to buy the \"Les Paul\" case.  If you buy this Electric case, which is what I am reviewing here,  your Les Paul will NOT fit!  Inside the case there are a couple of areas where you can put a couple of effects pedals, etc.  If you use mini-pedals, you might be able to fit four.  On the outside there is a large, zippered pocket that will fit a small laptop.  Plus, another zippered pocket that has see-thru mesh material.  The zippers are large and heavy duty.  This case is much easier to carry than your typical hard case.  Plus, it looks classy.  I'm glad I bought it.\n",
            "589 Fabtastic build quality and a very rich fuzzy goodness. Very surprised and not a let down at all. Light fuzz for some distored blues heavy fuzz for some unaudible grunge ruckus not meant to be perceived. Get it or be square, or a circle, or a rhombus. Im not your boss.\n",
            "590 I've bough a few of these. They work good. Not sure what else to say. They are not cheap-looking and hold the violin and the bow on the wall the way they should.\n",
            "591 Really. With this, there is no need for a pedaltrain pedal board. The build quality is the same and you can buy different sizes. The only con I can think of is that they don't provide a small strip of velcro for the bottom part of the board... Yet they provide velcro, most other boards don't.\n",
            "592 Was purchased 6-meter cable I had received was only 1.8 meters I think there is a mistake in the shipment\n",
            "593 I put these strings on an acoustic guitar I recently acquired and they sound great. I was going to try Eric Clapton signature strings but decided I wanted a lighter gauge and ordered these.\n",
            "594 Just got this today and I was pleasantly surprised by the whole package!  Well made case, legs and instrument.  This is my 2nd lap steel, my first was a Recording King.  I'm as pleased if not more because my RK did not have the screw on legs and has a better case and was a bit cheaper.  I will buy another in the future!\n",
            "595 The product description is entirely accurate. Great pickups for my RG Ibanez.\n",
            "596 I will be switching ALL of my snare drums to this head. Why?\n",
            "597 My experience with these have turned out great!\n",
            "598 Great stand for the money, very sturdy you will be happy.\n",
            "599 Nicely made, very secure, very plush on the inside.  And a bit heavy, but it keeps the guitar safe from my klutzy self.\n",
            "600 They came tarnished and discolored, I assume because they were clipped in during storage and shipping, see the pictures. They work with Schallers so you don't have to worry about compatibility and I guess they'll be covered up when I'm playing out, so it's not really that big of a deal but I'm still kind of disappointed. They're also quite a bit bigger but I'm not sure if I hate this, obviously I'm used to smaller Schallers however the larger washer means a more secure connection with my strap and more gold flair. I dunno, I'm still too disappointed with the discoloration.\n",
            "601 Awesome bass. I love it. As some other reviewers have commented this bass is not balanced as a standard solid body bass. the neck is definitely heavier due to the hollow body, but you know, that's the way it goes. I love the sound the hollow body gives you sounds a bit like my acoustic bass. The controls give a nice variety of sounds. I am something of a novice player but wanted to add a hollow body bass to my small collection and this Hofner replica is just the ticket. I think I might replace the strings that it came with as they sound a too metallic for my taste, but they are playable and hold tune well. I was able to play this bass right out of the box once I tuned it. No need for adjusting and didn't have that fret buss some reviewers have commented on. I did notice the neck is slimmer and the strings are closer together than any of my other basses, so that is an adjustment, but didn't take long to get into the swing of things. Fun to play and lightweight. Recommended.\n",
            "602 Mine were very stiff and hard to tune, no smoothness, like there was dirt or grit in the gears.  After installing one of the tuning keys got super stiff and before I could get up to tune the head snapped off.  Had to return entire set...pain in the azz.  Not worth the money in savings, going with Hipshots next.\n",
            "603 Looks amazing paired with the Neewer white/black mic boom arm and whiteout Blue Yeti mic!  Can definitely hear the difference with and without the filter.\n",
            "604 I have been playing for about 25 years on all kinds of gear. My Armand ride and hats never change, The crashes do from time to time. thought I would try a Wuhan crash. it sounds so good. I am so pleasantly surprised. The sound is bright and warm at the same time. the decay is not fast, but not too long either. Even the bell sounds good. I just ordered an 18 Gong crash and a 10 splash. I'll let you know!\n",
            "605 Squier Vintage Modified Jazz Bass.\n",
            "606 Its flimsy and for the awkward angles it sticks in a guitar the Vox device should be metal and sturdy, especially for price.  Mine broke within a week and I am a just a living room player.  I don't know how it broke but it did.  I will upload pictures.\n",
            "607 The neck had the most amazing finish.\n",
            "608 The paint job on this control plate is terrible, the paint is uneven and it even have \"bubble\" like sections.\n",
            "609 After trying to get by without it, I can't imagine trying to use my wah unattached any more. This thing is incredible for attaching a wah to a pedalboard. I just wish they made something just like this for all of my pedals. It's so much more secure than the sticky back stuff.\n",
            "610 This pair of Samson GT Studio Monitors was a great start for me, they aren't your loudest speakers, but they still pack a punch. They can still be mixed on, and give a good all around frequency response. What you want to be careful of is the bass, and mixing bass on these because they will not provide all of the bass that is really there. They are great for mids. The portability is amazing! Along with the fact that you will NOT need an audio interface with these! The Mic plugs directly into the speaker! What a easy and accessible way for an artist to record his vocals, or for a guitarist to to record his notes. Definitely a good investment!\n",
            "611 This box does everything I need it to. It's passive, so it doesn't color the sound, it makes for easy switching between my two sets of monitors, and even has an auxiliary input (RCA connection) with separate volume control (which I use to patch in an xbox. Gotta take 5 from working every once in a while!). The main volume knob is really smooth and has some slight resistance, which makes it feel great when dialing in levels.\n",
            "612 Deep tone and I'm a fan!\n",
            "613 These speakers sound great! I've had a pair of cube Auratone reference monitors for 30 yrs that still sound great but these iLouds are another level. Strong bass, crystal clear mids and highs. They are computer speakers on steroids! The pairing of inboard amp matched perfectly with the drivers makes sure you are getting great sound. They are Bluetooth capable too which I didn't even notice at first because it isn't stated loudly on the package. They aren't inexpensive but neither are good microphones and guitars. If you can afford the price, you will be pleased. Luckily my girlfriend gave me mine for Christmas :) Thank You Love!\n",
            "614 Great value for a hard case, holds lots of guitars, including jaguar, or even a Les Paul. Only issue is... that there's not enough padding,  and some guitars might knock around if You don't add some additional support.\n",
            "615 I Fit 9 Guitars in this. The 2 outside Pads Support 2 more on Stage! It was Cheap compared to Most Stands that Cost $75.00 to $100.00\n",
            "616 Fits my AT2035 like a glove. It DOES cover the entire grill (see picture), just took a little careful finagling to get it on. As some reviewers have said, it does come in a little baggy pressed flat. Mine has expanded nicely in just an afternoon. Doubt if there's much better for my mic at the same price. Highly recommend.\n",
            "617 I like this little small light! It fits in your hand and is a decent output of light. It is dmx which we all know is awesome! Dmx makes the world a little easier to control! The colors are red green blue and white. The only thing I do not like is the way the colors are mixed, you can see the outside of the color when you mix them. I would put one quad led in the fixture so it's all under one lense and there's no bleeding. But other than that this fixture is awesome!\n",
            "618 I've used this for 3 years every Halloween and it always has worked well for me.  After each use, I rinse the tank out with distilled water, then run the unit until just steam comes out, then I dump the water and store the unit dry.  I've heard of people who think you should store the units full of fog juice, but I've heard of people who say the pump gets gunky if you do that.\n",
            "619 This stereo audio jack splitter worked smoothly for me, allowing me to connect 2 headphones to one audio output and also to connect an audio output from a music keyboard to a PC and headphones simultaneously. It's inexpensive and came without any instructions or retail packaging, while it was fine for my needs.\n",
            "620 Wow this thing is so cool I play it threw two orange 8\" cabs it is my favorite practice amp by far. Three knows zero bull $#!+. Once I turn it up around 2 my dog starts to howl no joke I really goes. I'm going to try jamming with it here soon and see how it contends with my brute of a drummer. It can go from clean to pretty dirty but if you really want to get nasty you will need a nice hot humbucker and a distortion pedal. I dug it's sound I didn't bother with a pedal for the first week. Can't go wrong for the price. The little tube in the preamp does really make it sound good.\n",
            "621 Tried a number of noise gates, including the EHX silencer.  This one blows them all away.  Wanted a gate that would allow me to roll off my volume knob in crunch mode and still gate.  This is the only one that really works.  Get it!\n",
            "622 Exactly what I needed to give my studio professional sound quality. Also fairly easy to install, I suggest using t-pins either 1.5in or 2in. Overall very happy with it.\n",
            "623 Can't really complain too much for the price. Had a little spot where the paint had flaked off with some rust underneath, and a couple of the 1/4\" jacks are a little loose in the center (when I tried to tighten the nut, the whole center part of the jack rotated), but overall they're decent. Got all the terminals soldered together and mounted the crossover right to the plate, and everything seems to work just fine.\n",
            "624 Many people think that a electric guitar for around 100 bucks is cheap and sounds terrible. this guitar makes that opinion wrong. this guitar is amazing for the price. the first part of the guitars character you notice is the beautiful red color. it looks beautiful and is really eye catching. the playability is nice with a good action. the strings it comes with are decent factory strings but i changed them anyway for better sound. the volume and tone knobs are cool looking also. the tune o matic bridge helps alot and kept my guitar in tune for days. this guitar also comes with a amp cable , some papers, owners guide, a poster and a big epiphone sticker. who doesnt love stickers? lol. i highly recommend this guitar to beginners and those who have been playing for a while. the sound quality is amazing for the price you get.\n",
            "625 This is my absolute favorite guitar strap amongst those I've purchased.  I'm using it with an antique German lute guitar (wandervogellaute), and the stained glass pattern complements the carved rosette of the sound hole in a vaguely ecclesiastical motif -- while still looking a little hippie.  The lute guitar is extremely lightweight, so I can't speak to how well the strap would hold up a heavy solid body electric guitar, but it seems to be very sturdily made, and is definitely comfortable.\n",
            "626 I really like the simplicity of this bridge. It adjusts easy for string height and length. It comes with all the mounting screws and even a small allen wrench to make the height adjustments. The provided mounting screws are Phillips head screws. The one thing that I missed when I ordered this was the fact that it is not a bridge for string-thru the guitar body placement. The strings dead end to the stop-flair of the plate. I included a picture of this so it may help to make others aware that it is not for string-thru applications. No biggie tho for me, I will use it on another project now.\n",
            "627 They are nice picks but much smaller than they appear in your photos!\n",
            "628 Perfect fit on my 2016 Gibson Les Paul Studio Faded.  I didn't like the original speed knobs because they were too big and clunky-feeling. I was skeptical about these knobs after reading some reviews about poor quality, but I think they're very high quality.  The finish is perfect on them:  No seams, scratches, chips, etc.  I don't know what more someone could expect quality-wise.\n",
            "629 This is the second Neewer boom arm I have purchased, as I have added a second recording capable computer to my battle station for my son to be able to record voice and gameplay. I was pleasantly surprised to see the one thing I disliked about mine had been changed. The mount that attaches to your desk has received an upgrade, allowing for a tighter fit on the boom arm stalk, and a more robust build of the mount overall. My previous mount had a D-shaped hole the boom arm stalk slipped into, which allowed for a lot of movement regardless of how tight you made the clamping screw. It was also equipped with an oversized plastic wingnut for securing the mount to the desk. The upgraded mount rectifies both those issues.\n",
            "630 I received this pedal as a gift.  A compressor is a subtle effect, but it has made a great addition to my pedal board.  The construction of the pedal is solid.  It adds character to chords and enhances leads.  I am currently using the pedal with the sustain at 1 o'clock, the attack at noon, and the volume at 10 o'clock.  The volume provides a very strong boost after 11 o'clock.  Overall, good pedal for the price.\n",
            "631 I wanted something light and compact that can hold a few items, but also fit well in a carry-on and protect the jamstik indoors or out. This case is the perfect solution, and has a nice, adjustable strap as well. Good  durable construction and love having the jamstik label to show it off!\n",
            "632 This was a great value. The wood I received looked outstanding and all the parts were there and fit well. I did some customization to the look and added a couple of other pickups for some diversity but the components I received were of reasonable quality. The guitar looks and plays great after a bit of neck adjustment and setup. Very satisfied.\n",
            "633 There are only a few things I needed to know before I purchased this Alto/Tenor stand.  1.  Did it hold my Tenor and Soprano properly? 2.  Would this particular stand work properly on different surfaces? 3.  Is the design portable and easy for setup for gigs/home use to easily swap for doubled soprano?\n",
            "634 Never levelled frets before I picked this thing up. The concept seemed simple enough. I figured that, due to the weight of this block, little to no pressure would be required and that was a good call.\n",
            "635 This is a very nice Crash / Ride Cymbal. I'm using it for a smaller kit I'm using for a school I'm working at. The kids seem to enjoy the sound, and it's taking a beating. Its holding up to the challenge.\n",
            "636 I had this put together in less than 5 minutes, and made my 3-guitar stand a 4-guitar stand.\n",
            "637 The direct drive assembles and mounts easily. It works well with the right foot and is responsive. Also, it adjusts easily for travel and mallet through. It provides a distinct bass sound freeing up your two hands on the Cajon. It will provide more of a drum kit sound particularly if your Cajon has string sound.\n",
            "638 This is a great, sturdy stand.  I'm using it for a classical and a flamenco guitar, and they are very secure in the stand.  It's also easy to lift either guitar out without banging one into the other even while seated.  I've also set a concert ukulele in the double stand with no problem.\n",
            "639 I bought this stand for church because I been blessed with a soprano and a alto sax and its realy good and reliable and fit in the front poutch of my sax case with no problems (my alto case has a exstra poutch in the front) but one little thing is that the peg can fit a soprano but its just a little lose but it still is safe for soprano sax.\n",
            "640 This pedal is a Tube Screamer, or more correctly an exact replica. When mine came in the mail, I took it out of the box, plugged in my 300ma neg pin power supply, and immediately created a warm, old tube amp tone. I need to get a new, daisy chain chord, so I can use all my pedals at once, but I have no noise issues (those who do have ground loop issues). I also used a pen to push in the two pedal flap hinge pins to remove it and expose the battery compartment. Anyone who removes the Phillips screws to disassemble the pedal (removing the bottom) obviously has problems understanding directions. I will not, however, ever be using batteries.\n",
            "641 I have two of these.  They are rock solid.  I have never had a problem with them, at all.  Very easy to attach to a wall.  Find a stud or use heavy drywall anchors.  I got ones that screw right into the wall and this setup works great.\n",
            "642 Now all I have to do is install these on my Burswood Strat Copy. I know I'm gonna have to drill holes for the locating pins I may even have to drill the tuner holes also. Look forward to getting those crappy, loose, un-smooth, original hardware tuners off this thing.\n",
            "643 We used this one in the middle as seen in the picture holding the white guitar. BIG MISTAKE! The guitar almost was destroyed. This is NOT strong enough to hold a 7 string Schecter Omen guitar. While it worked out and seemed secure at first. Literally 7 days later the guitar had almost fell to the floor. I wouldn't recommend this for heavier guitars. Instead we will be keeping the guitar in the stand where it is safer.\n",
            "644 Great looking additions! !!\n",
            "645 This is real bone. Took a while to file them down to lower the action and replace the plastic parts on a cheap guitar.  But it has improved the sound quality immensely. Well worth it!\n",
            "646 I'm a guitar player who sometimes needs to play bass.  My brother bought me for Christmas.  I was pleasantly surprised by this guitar's feel and sound when unplugged!  It FEELS solid and has great sustain unplugged!  It played easy right out of the box though I will eventually get it set up but I'm not in a rush.  With this gift came a Fender Rumble 25 bass amp that for what I need is perfect and sounds great.  I'm very impressed overall and would recommend this bass to someone looking for a quality instrument without the \"quality\" price tag.\n",
            "647 If you own a J45 these are strings for that guitar. I have a J45 custom and I have tried other strings, but these give it that Gibson sound.\n",
            "648 Using this to get complete control over my signal going into in-ear monitors\n",
            "649 Was excited to get this case at a great price. It was very disappointing to receive the case and find that it would not close and latch completely right out of the box. The top and bottom case just don't seem to fit together right. Seems to be bad quality control.\n",
            "650 So strange this happens on a brand new set of strings. This brand used to be trusted by me.\n",
            "651 While I wasn't sure this would fit my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9, I was pleasantly surprised. Whats impressive is how secure my iPad feels in the grip of the two sets of prongs.\n",
            "652 Was hoping it would be half in longer. Hohner does not seem to carry a size to fit a \"full orchestra\" 40 read model\n",

            "654 hello this isa great bass comin from a seasonal 40 something year old i love this bass it has a nice warm tone don't let this price fool ya get off your easy chair and buy this already  its not cheap in a lot of ways very durable and i said it first good for gigs not a starter bass like its called this will hold up thanks alot\n",
            "655 I have uses many condenser microphones in my time and this is the best product I have used. This is now my go to mic. The sound is amazing!!! I have a very deep voice and sing or talking on this mic you can really make out my baritone voice. I highly recommend this product for the beginner to the professional. What a wonderful mic at a great price.\n",

            "657 The cheap black screw broke.\n",
            "658 Wow what a difference from bare fingers. Really nails the tones down with very little effort. Very smooth metal and plastic. Large fit my mits well. Barely opened the middle finger and that was it. Been picking for hours and haven't had and movement so far. I'm a 6'3\" skinny guy so large hands but skinny fingers. Large was perfect. Right up to the first knuckle was snug and comfortable. The thumb picks are even better!\n",
            "659 I needed to replace poorly built, wobbly and ugly green Wilkinson tuners on my Vintage V100PGM ICON Lemon Drop Greeny guitar.\n",
            "660 I chose this beater just so that I could be more like Bonham.  It has replaced the stock Yamaha beater on my direct drive 9500 pedal.  It is very light and it feels great coming off the batter head.  I have not made any adjustments since swapping out the beater, but I am considering putting a little weight on the beater to make it feel a little more significant.  As far as sound, it's the old school thump.  With my 24\", it rings ever so beautifully.  This may not work so well for hard rock or metal.  Too much bong and not enough bop.\n",
            "661 I bought this for my monoprice les paul copy, as it doesn't come with a pickup selector plate or pickguard. I'm happy with the color and quality, it came with a bunch of screws and a pick. I didn't need the backplates, but they are the right size. For the price I'm happy, as the pickguard alone can run anywhere from $10-20.\n",
            "662 Great little compact mixer. Super versatile. Loving it for my basement studio.\n",
            "663 This is the second ChromaCast hard guitar case that I have purchased and I like both of them! I needed a hard case for my Schecter OMEN-6 guitar. I find myself playing this guitar more and more. I had bought a Schecter hard guitar case from Amazon Warehouse Deals but it didn't fit my guitar (the description said it would). I emailed ChromaCast and they said the CC-EHC case would work. It's a really nice case! It's a good value for the price. I saw the bad reviews for this guitar case and I can tell you that have not had a problem with either one of my cases.\n",
            "664 Purchased after studying the reviews on quality, which is accurate for this mount. It timely arrived. The center mike holder opening is for a much larger microphone than the ATR 2100, that I own. The 2100 indicates 51mm, but that is at the mike area, not the trunk which is much smaller and used for mounting to the shock mount. After researching a replacement in the same price range, I found none. I had some foam pipe insulation for 1/2 inch pvc pipe in the utility room. This is readily available from most any big box hardware store.  I cut the foam about 4\" in length and placed the 2100 in the foam. It fits perfect. I didn't seal the foam, but it is just right and tight in the mount holder. I now have a shock mount that can be used if, and when, I purchase a larger microphone. I have attached a photo. After the image was created, I further trimmed the foam length to match the actual size of the mounting holder opening.  This shock mount is a quality product at a great price.\n",
            "665 This is the worst fitting junk I have ever seen! The pickgaurd is to big and the back plates are to small and the holes do not line up. I could make the pick guard work but it would take time with a drimel to make sure it fit properly without any gaps. The back plates are almost a full 1/4 inch off. waste of time and money.\n",
            "666 Very awesome strap! It looks exponentially cool! Leather ends are supple enough to install to strap buttons easily. Strap itself is really soft, so it doesn't irritate your shoulders and neck while you're playing your guitar. It adjusts pretty easy to your desired length. Buckle is plastic. You may or may not have an issue with that. I personally didn't. It looks amazing, and that's putting it kindly. I've gotten many compliments on it already. Definitely worth the money. As a back story, I was born on the year of the Dragon, so it's only fitting I bought this strap.\n",
            "667 Exactly what I needed, and worked for all different sized instruments. Created the perfect wall piece for my music room. Acoustic, electric, classical and two different size ukuleles. Perfect!\n",
            "668 Great for tuning a lap harp that we got for 5 bucks at a yard sale. The brand in Russian is \"Perepolotchka\" and the back of the harp says \"Made in USSR\". We were so pleased to find this!\n",
            "669 Amazing quality. Stays in tune. Love everything about it!\n",
            "670 This is great sounding at a great price! Is it perfect? No, but it is no less perfect than something costing a lot more and not sounding as good as this pedal. I read one review in which the guy was not satisfied because he said it sounded like \"80's glam rock.\" I totally disagree. If you can play and have a decent amp - you can get a variety of great sounds out of this little box. It seems like so many players like a fuzzy, buzzy type overdrive sound. I prefer a thicker creamy sound and you can dial that up with this pedal. For a mere $35, I was willing to roll the dice - I found a diamond in the rough.\n",
            "671 This is a great cartridge.  It was easy to setup and has a very nice sound.  I also have a Shure m97xe, but I prefer the sound of this one.  Originally, I had issues with it.  The sound was muffled and flat.  To correct it, I reinstalled the stylus until it clicked onto the front.  Sounds great now.\n",

I have also dropped it more than once and it has proven to be durable, as well.  I am actually using it as a practice bass amp and it sounds like playing a bass through a guitar amp, which is acceptable for practice.  I gave it to my guitar player to use and he was very impressed with the improvement in the product, having used other 9 volt practice amps in the past.  Can easily be used to amplify any personal sound needs by using or purchasing a 1/4\" input adapters.  It does not include a power adapter, which would have been a nice addition, so you have to use 9 volt batteries to power your practice sessions.  Watch my demonstration video.\n",

            "675 This pedal have been a good addition to my pedal board.  It did take some time to dial in the right mix and level.  I personally do not use the chorus and vibrato, but it does add a cool later to the sound.  The delay is very good and natural sounding.  This pedal is a great alternative to similar pedals that are much more expensive.\n",
            "676 Extremely impressed with this kit.\n",
            "677 (Review is based on using it with the PYLE PSMRS11 Acoustic Isolation Microphone shield, you can buy it as a package. I bought mine separately) It is one heavy duty mic stand, but I got it for holding up the PYLE PSMRS11 Acoustic Isolation Microphone shield and the damn shield was too heavy to hold in place!  It kept falling over. This mic stand was sold to hold the darn thing but it only works if you place the Isolation Shield in a certain direction (see picture). You must remove the rubber pads that are on the Microphone shield, if you don't you'll find your Isolation shield on the floor! The weight is too heavy for the rubber pads to hold them up (they are glued on). So you have to tighten metal to metal to hold the shield in place. You have to constantly check the tightening supports to make sure they don't pull the support stand down with it! You also have to remove the bottom metal desk supports from the Mic Shield to lighten the load on the Mic Stand. I hope this helps everyone using this for a Mic Shield.\n",
            "678 NICE.. Wish had a little bit more of Low end feel. Super loud.. Does the job.\n",
            "679 definitely a good purchase. nice and comfy for long sessions and the sound is crystal clear\n",
            "680 I have 3 of these now and I like that I can fit any type of guitar on there at the same time, even if they have straps on them. I have other stands that are spaced closer together and even a tremolo bar can get in the way. For those who have complained about no instructions being included, there are two bolts and 4 wheels. If you can't figure that out then maybe putting stuff together isn't your thing.\n",
            "681 The Head piece is a little wobbly but it's overall sturdy. Holds my guitar grimoire just fine and it's on the heavy side .\n",
            "682 Easy as heck to put on, In my opinion better than sperzel. These took literally 10 minutes to put on my  MIM strat.\n",
            "683 If you're looking for mixer to really get busy when it comes to scratching, mixing, or whatever, trust me you need to jump on this mixer right here.\n",
            "684 Did not notice when I ordered this that are no holes pre drilled for the pickup?  When trying to drill prep the product it simply cracked.\n",
            "685 Items work, but the description doesn't match the product. These are not RGBW Led, they were instead RGB.\n",
            "686 This is horrible, poorly made stand. Chinese knock-off quality. Probably the worst quality hardware item I've bought in years, and I own many crappy Dixon cymbal stands. The wingnuts look like stock items in 1950's budget sets. The main tube OD is MAYBE 1/2\". Just atrocious. If I were Mapex, I wouldn't put my name on this. I'd return it, but I'm only using it for a practice pad, so I guess it will do. Spend another $20 and get something decent.\n",
            "687 This is for my son in his rehearsal room and they are perfect! Great quality, arrived within a few days and the price you cant beat!\n",
            "688 Not bad at all for the price.  Cheaper on Amazon than ebay.  Installation was straight forward after watching some youtube videos.  I would watch out for the EXACT shape when cutting the holes in the body.  The larger piece has a couple of 'clipped' corners that need to be left on the body for the screws to grab.  Sounds great and the tuner is accurate.\n",
            "689 This is not Fretboard Oil Cleaner. It is pure magic! If you love your guitars and basses, you will purchase this immediately and start treating them with the love and care they deserve. It is sooooo easy to use, and a little goes a very long way. I recently worked on a mid '60s Harmony Rocket and the fretboard was, well, disgusting. I have included some before and after pics of the fretboard after crowning and polishing the frets and then cleaning it using Nomad. Judge for yourself.\n",
            "690 I love this pickguard, looks so cool on my red Telecaster, matches all the other chrome hardware, made of metal and does NOT scratch! Every one that sees my Telecaster loves it! Thanks! Good price also, saw several other sellers with this product, this seller had the best price by far! Packaged VERY well and delivered in a timely manner!\n",
            "691 I think this is good, the range of height is too short for the price. You can get a larger and heaviest for $1 or $2 more\n",
            "692 I originally installed these on my semi-hollow body Gretch D6128 Thunderbass in an attempt to cut down on the string and fret noise I was getting with conventional strings.\n",
            "693 Stretch them strings !\n",
            "694 I was able to install my new guitar hanger easily. I found a stud exactly where I wanted to install it, and I predrilled the holes to accommodate the two long wood screws; drywall anchors are included in the package.\n",
            "695 This bridge is beyond iconic and needed for any Telecaster build. Looks beautiful on any body that you put it on!\n",
            "696 But don't let that deter you. That just means it will break-in that much more quickly. My favorite strap is not padded in any way, like this strap, but a little wider. I use this on a Telecaster and it looks nice and matches well with the color scheme of the guitar.

The strap is made in Canada from decent quality leather(not bonded) and the gold Fender logo is understated, yet classy. It's a classic strap from Fender. What else is there to say?\n",
            "697 I purchased these for a Cigar Box Guitar, they work great for that purpose.  I have no complaints.\n",
            "698 The mixer has good build. Knobs, and sliders are smooth. Buttons click with no crackling. It is quite.. no hiss. (Unless turn pre-amps wide open). I'm not a big fan of RCA jacks..but it is portable. Best pick compared to other battery powered mixers IMO. Mixer is on top/left of pedalboard in the pics. I had to used RCA right angle adapters so would fit in the pedalboard case.\n",
            "699 This case was bought for my Epiphone Les Paul Black Beauty 3 which fits inside pretty well, although there is a little wiggle room. The case appears to be built well, however, the case lid is misaligned with the base section when closed shut. The lid should overlap the bottom case similar to how a shoe box lid fits on top of its box. The misalignment creates an odd gap which is only noticeable upon close inspection. I have a similar Epiphone case for my Sheraton and that case closes properly like my shoe box example. So beware production quality may not be consistant and could vary on a case to case basis (I couldn't resist that pun).\n",
            "700 We opened the case and immediately saw the bow had strings visibly hanging off of it.  When we turned the latch to remove the bow to inspect it, we could see that several strings were caught in the the latch.  It took several minutes to carefully extracate it from the latch without breaking even more strings. Not sure if this was previously used and returned as new or just carelessly packed.  We haven't tuned it yet and will update our review on the actual violin later.  At this point, I am concerned.\n",
            "701 Fit my 1999 Taylor 414CE with only minor thinning.  Had to adjust for action height, of course.  Was twice the height it needed to be.  Works well.  Intonation is solid.  Sounds fine.  Noticeably more high end sparkle in the treble strings.\n",
            "702 My Les Paul guitar fits nicely in this gig bag, so does my stratocaster, it has 3 large zip up storage compartments for picks, tuners, sheet music, cords, strings, and more. Its nicely made and is rather protective for the guitar, the material isn't really soft so beware guitar scratches, but this gig bag is very nice, I'd recommend it to anyone needing a good quality gig bag.\n",
            "703 I cannot say enough good things about this particular guitar strap. I have several Walker & Williams straps and not a one of them is a loser, but when I pulled this out of the packaging yesterday, I immediately fell in love with it. Buttery smooth, real leather smell, nice stitching - just an overall quality piece of work. Looks beautiful on my Hagstrom. Couldn't be happier.\n",
            "704 This is a great stereo reverb with plenty of control to get the sounds I want. The toneprint is a great feature to check out the settings from some great artists. I am completely satisfied with the features and sound of this pedal and highly recommend it!\n",
            "705 You know, for a low-cost item, these do a pretty good job.  We are using them for filler lights to keep shadows down on the stage. My friend has an earlier version that does not include the fans and he had issues with them flickering due to overheating.  With the fans added, although noisy, it seems to eliminate the flickering issue.\n",
            "706 This kit is incredible !!  The quality is great for the investment.  I have been playing a Ludwig kit that is ok, but these are really higher quality. The finish and hardware are very nice, and maple is a plus also.\n",
            "707 Pretty simple perfect fit a little thicker than the original used it for a vintage modified 70s squire strat to give it an even more classic look. It was very easy to put on just watch a youtube video youll be fine. The black backplate adds a nice touch i have silver and black hardware so that worked out. I felt that the screws they gave me weren't as good as my originals. I did not use them. I think this product is a bit overpriced but thats probably because its laser etched. Adds a nice touch without seeming like you are trying to pass your guitar off for something more expensive. Here are some pictures.\n",
            "708 Can't say they look exactly like what's in the picture, especially since they don't have that gold ring around the center. However they're still perfectly usable, cheap, and still look neat on the guitar\n",
            "709 Perfect! Go get it don't delay, quick and easy install...........\n",
            "710 I have a 35 scale bass so I figured these strings would seem fitting. Well, I was wrong and forgot to account that my strings don't get feed through the bridge but get feed through the backside. The tapered part of the stings sit between the 1st fret and nut and causes it to buzz as seen in my photos. If you have a bass set up like mine, go with Ernie Balls.\n",
            "711 Installed these in my Ibanez  AS53 with no problem.  Probably not the application intended by the mfg, as they are intended to replicate active metal pickups. The Neck pickup is pretty dark, and lacks volume and clarity. The bridge pickup is louder, and brighter than the neck. I've had both better, and worse pickups... these are just alright. If I had it to do all over again, I probably would have just left the stock pickups in the guitar. It's not worth sending back, as the product does actually work, and tone is such a personal and subjective thing. I'm rating three stars as a neutral rating.\n",
            "712 Like these a lot. Easy install. Be sure to go to graphtech website and follow their instructions on how to check which model fits in your bridge, pro tip: glossy finishes can help you see the bottom side of your bridge without taking it off or using a little specialty mirror tool. Did I mention the things look damn sexy?\n",
            "713 Great material and very easy to work with. I cut this on my band saw with no issue and the surface cleans up very nice after cutting.\n",
            "714 A few weeks ago I bought the WP (white pearl) stickers which I really liked although I even said in my review that they have a slightly gray or silver cast to them. I just got another set, this time the AWP (aged white pearl) set and I'm glad I did. Tbhey do NOT look like stickers and you really can't tell unless you get your nose right on them. These actually look like aged pearl. They look freakin real. Check the image, it shows the WP set on the left and the AWP on the right. The pics aren't too good but good enough that you can see the difference..\n",
            "715 I have only had this pedal a few hours. It does what they say, maybe better than they say. I ran it through its paces with my Telecaster and was amazed. It can sound like the very costly Lesley pedals that go for near $400 but all that for only $50. I am happy, only 4 stars because I don't trust Behringer. I never had any of their stuff last that long.\n",
            "716 Excellent quality for the price. Can be trimmed to fit smaller speakers. I put two of them under my center channel on my home theater.\n",
            "717 Gibraltar makes good stuff...really good. But I have to return it as the inside diameter of the utility side of the bracket is 1 3/8 fully closed.\n",
            "718 I bought this bass to split time as my primary bass with my Dean Edge. This might be winning me over. The bass boost is outstanding. The active pickups really allow you to adjust to the sound you want. I recommend this for anyone. If you're a beginner  like I was not too long ago, it's an excellent bass to start with. If you're on tour and/or music is making you money, this bass will be beatiful on stage. The color is a bit darker than in the picture. But, all around, this is a great buy.\n",
            "719 I picked this up to help complete an overhaul of my '78 strat. Everything lined up perfectly, and this product was every bit as high quality as the original. Took just over 2 weeks to arrive (which was about what I was expecting). Very pleased with everything.\n",
            "720 The product was well packaged, and looks great right out of the box. The keys are full sized, and the keyboard is light without feeling cheap.\n",
            "721 After much online shopping, and 20 years of using traditional stands, I needed something with easier access and greater stability than the standard 3 leg stands. I had six guitars in stands, and this Hercules unit had the best reviews. The box arrived in great shape, and I pulled out the stand and popped it open and it was ready to go. Included was additional parts to add a 6th guitar to the stand, which I needed. Very easy to configure the spacing, and load the guitars, stable. Now it is easy for me to grab a guitar to play and then put away. I have an acoustic, 3 electrics, a semi-hollow body electric (E335 style), and a bass. Highly recommended.\n",
            "722 Well built.  Nice carrying case.  Comes with plenty of hook and loop.  I'd recommend getting some hook and loop cable ties instead of the plastic ones included.  The dimensions make the most sense of the different brand large boards that I looked at.  See pic for reference.\n",
            "723 I like em! Got a 3-pack, and now my cheap guitars don't have to sit on the floor. Easy to assemble, pretty sturdy. Almost knocked one over, and it righted itself impressively.\n",
            "724 Absolutely love it. Does exactly what I need it to do with utmost confidence. I can even shove 6 guitars, acoustic or electric IN CASES with this rack. Is it expensive? Yes, but is it worth it? Many times over.\n",
            "725 Hold tune ok, but string clamps loosen while tuning.\n",
            "726 At first, this would not work with the AT2020 USB+  microphone.  The pole is too thick to screw into the mount that comes with the mic.\n",
            "727 iT WOULD BE EASY TO BLAME THE GUITAR BUT sOME OF MY FELLOW MUSIANS HAVE TRIED IT WITH THERE GUITAR ANS SAME THING.. MOST PRO-NOUNCED ON THE HIGHEST STRINGS.. ALL THE STRINGS HAVE THE SAME VOLUME OR DYNAMICS. WHETHER I PLAY MY 335 OR MY SOUTHWESTERN. ACOUSTIC. THIS IS IMPORTANT TO ME AS I BUSK SOLO.\n",
            "728 awesome! i had the old mini, but this orientation had more useful space! pictured here is my board.\n",
            "729 Several items broken upon arrival. The fix was me gigging it up and not their fix. Warranty what warranty? Spend your money elsewhere. Very dissatisfied and disappointing to say the least. I've gotten better deals and service off Craigslist\n",
            "730 Sticks on great. It also holds on extremely tight. And when i take it of my finish is perfect\n",

            "732 VERSATILITY/MULTIPLAYER MIC-RECORDER\n",
            "733 It's a great deal, very good product for the money, but you need to be aware that your instrument (especially acoustics) will need to have the adjustable center arm raised considerably in order to keep the headstocks from bumping. The higher you raise it, the farther apart the headstocks will be BUT the higher you raise it the less backward tilt of the guitars. Less tilt, less stability, so be sure to use the attached neck holders. The attached photo shows two full size acoustics with the center arm about 80% raised and the headstocks are about an inch apart. Any lower and they touch.\n",
            "734 Amazon's product states that this shock mount fits 43 to 50mm diameter mics. It does not. It will not even fit my MXL V69XM which specs out at 47 mm diameter. See the photos ... it does not fit even with a white-knuckle effort to open the jaws. I ordered three through Amazon and none of them came in a Neewer box that was shown. Grossly under-size!\n",
            "735 Great Quality, adjustable tension. Well made.\n",
            "736 These go wonderfully with my Zakk Wylde Les Paul Custom Plus Grail. Been using Dunlop Straploks for years. They definitely take a beating. Granted I am not doing around the worlds and jumping around stage like a coke head, that behavior will destroy nearly any product, especially with wood and small screws. However, they definitely withstand some metal stage presence. Had some issues with seating but hats user error. Push the button and ensure it is fully seated and protect your guitar and investment. Easy day.\n",
            "737 Works perfectly for my ukuleles and guitars. Simple to use. Instant on and off. Perfect tuner!\n",
            "738 I bought a set of these to upgrade my Kona K1ETRD, a vast improvement over the old ones, now it stays in tune better and they're very smooth, looks nice too!\n",
            "739 This desk stand is small enough to easily fit inside my field bag, doesn't weigh much, and does its job effectively. Although it is small, it is still able to sturdily hold my RODE NTG2 microphone without danger of tipping over. Clipping the long microphone to the stand at the very end of the shotgun is a little precarious but I have made it work. It probably helps that the rode screw-on is very heavy, allowing the center of balance to be closer to the center of the stand.\n",
            "740 a little bit shorter than expected but pretty good\n",
            "741 Actually surprised. I originally intended to use this as a low gain type pedal but when I unintentionally cascades this into my Rat 2 pedal, a magical thing happened. This guy opened up the mids in the rat pedal. I am running the rat at 18volts with excellent results. This drive pedal is set at gain 2 and cascading into the rat pedal. Excellent! Immediately earning a prized spot on my board.\n",
            "742 I love the trashiness of this China! Hard to believe it's only a 12inch but it's sounds pretty powerful. I like it! Get one.\n",
            "743 Worked perfect for what I needed them for!!!!\n",
            "744 Doesn't conform to my Taylor 110 very well, causing lower strings to not push down enough and be muted or buzz. Tried readjusting 20 different ways to no luck. Been playing this guitar with capos for 12 years, never had a problem before.\n",
            "745 This is a basic pedal for vocal enhancements, but it lacks in the department of effects and customization. It would have been nice to have more effects and greater control over their parameters.\n",
            "746 Works perfectly with nylon flamenco and classical guitars. Use it in studio, on stage, never failed, great battery life, bright, sensitive.\n",
            "747 it's more on toy side than on instrument side, and made in Indonesia.\n",
            "748 Great little pedal. Wonderful brand. Well built equipment with quality. The housing feels solid and well manufactured. With sound in mind it has a fantastic beautiful depth to it. As a guitarist with roots in rock, grunge and metal it can be a versatile sound with the right mixture. Combined with a marshall tube dc40 and it will not leave you unhappy.\n",
            "749 This was a gift from my sister and brother in law for babysitting there kids until school start. I have to say this is an Amazing Guitar. For 200$ it's worth the buy and if your new to 7 string guitars you'll love it. Well shipped and a well made guitar. I couldn't be any more happier with the White looks so sick.\n",
            "750 For the price, this is awesome. The heel is larger than a standard Fender neck. If you're building the body, just make a template off the neck itself. The nut is cheap plastic. Buzz at high E 5th fret was fixed just by tapping lightly on the fret with a small hammer. Fret ends are sharp but not dangerous. Not too fat, nor thin. Truss rod turned free and easy.\n",
            "751 These are alot better than the Mahalo felt picks I've been using on my ukuleles. The Mahalos are soft, fat and flat, these are stiff, thinner and tapered, meaning they're easier to hold and play with and I get sharper sound. The 12 I got should last for quite some time, the Mahalos are showing more wear. Probably everyone should get some felt picks, very useful and alot of fun; these are really good ones.\n",
            "752 This braided cable is one of the nicest I've ever used that was under $50. The sound is crisp and not distorted with no buzz or ground hum, even jumping on the cable did not produce any undesired sound bleed. The ends are gold plated for increased connectivity and the ends are well shielded with a quality heat shield tubing covering the wire connections. the end covers are well threaded and do not loosen themselves after use. I have been playing for 15 years now both live and studio and haven't found cables this nice that did not have a hefty price tag. I plan to pick up a few more of these in different lengths to replace some others I've used i like them that much. I did receive this product at a discount in return for a fair unbiased opinion. If my review was helpful to you please click the yes button.\n",
            "753 As with other dean guitars this does not disappoint. Finish is perfect at least on mine. Grover tuners that stay in tune(my gibson sg's???).\n",

            "755 Let Me Start Of By Saying That This Is My First New Drum Set In 10 Years, And It Totally Rocks,It Is A Great Sounding Set! (Wouldn't Hurt To Upgrade Heads And Cymbals) But The Current Ones Will Hold Over, Until I Can Get Upgrades Other Than That I Am Very Happy With This Set It Is An Excellent Upgrade From My Old One And Comes Through 100% Best Purchase Made! (Silver Snare Drum Is My Own) Not To Confuse It With The Set.\n",

            "759 Very poor quality. Two of the pegs are missing part of or all insert. Back they go. Wouldn't waste your time or money on these.\n",
            "760 You can find cheaper power supply units, but they tend to add noise.  Thanks to Amazon's return policy, I was able to try out a couple units.  The MXR M238 unit worked great and is very quiet.  Pedals can be very picky and I had trouble with chaining some of the pedals together.  The MXR pedal was the best option for me, it had enough sockets and the size of the unit worked great for my board.\n",
            "761 I recently started using very light guage carbon strings (E1 is .024 inches) and E1 and B needed double knots (triple knots on E1)  to keep them tied and tuned.  Even then sometimes E1 would come loose.  A friend told me about string ties and suggested they might solve the problem. I looked around at the various tie systems available and I bought the Diamond Secure Classical Guitar String Ties because I liked the size. The result was what I needed; B and E1 don't slip with the ties and they stay in tune. I did a double loop with E1 as suggested in the instructions, just to be sure. I was concerned about the appearance of the Ties, but I am satisfied with the look. The Ties are small and have an unobtrusive,  neat appearance.  The attached picture shows my first effort with the Ties. In terms of sound or effect on the guitar I don't hear any difference, but the Ties do simplify the process of tying on strings.\n",
            "762 Excellent budget 7 string , Had to touch up the fret work a bit and tighten down some of the screws but other than that it was perfect . Replaced the original strings with 11-64 for A standard tuning . i wasn't sure if i was getting 22 or 24 frets on the guitar as it said both in the description but it did come with 24 frets . Have been playing Korn and trivium covers so far and its perfect for it . Stock ESP pups are not to bad , decent tone , i'm using a peavy 6505+ amp .\n",
            "763 Thus should be a 5 star review, but sadly, it's only a 3. I bought a cymbal off of eBay that was a mess. I got it for next to nothing and figured I would clean it up. Cleaner sure worked well and then THANKFULLY I read to not use on the Letters. Holy cow I was this close to cleaning up those areas when thankfully someone called me and I read the entire bottle to the very end.\n",
            "764 I got this for my Ibanez EW20ASE.... the pin on the back of the body by the neck was too far recessed to get the rigid plastic ratched clasp on it.... I was mad for about 10 seconds. Great quality strap, looks fantastic, feels great to the hand and the locks are nothing to sneeze at, they really lock to your pins. So, I took it and put it on my Ibanez AS93 (a fairly heavy guitar for being semi-hollow) and they fit, perfectly. I had just done a string change and spent a little over an hour playing and breaking the strings in, this strap is super comfy (especially for not being padded). The material is somewhere between satin and a seatbelt with a cool stitched \"xxx/diamond\" design (that's my words, not Planet Waves). Absolutely love it and VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND for use with any guitar that doesn't have recessed strap pins) A++++++\n",
            "765 Oh my word I am sold I love my AT2100 which Ive used for 5+ years for podcasting and YouTube BUT this thing is amazing for my current use case. Im using it as a boom above my head for YouTube videos. Wow! At about 2-3 feet away it is perfect. Very rich sound for my bassy voice. I recommend this to anyone who wants a budget mic with awesome sound.\n",
            "766 I've got a five person band for our Hawaiian performing arts group. These headsets make for even audio. No fading in and out as a singer moves closer or farther away from the mic, or turns her face to the right or left. They use the Shure SM58 pick-ups which are time proven. These headsets are especially good when I want to record a live performance. Anyone want to buy my stick mics and stands?\n",
            "767 I ordered this case to travel to Brazil with my 335. Fits perfectly as its not an actual Gibson 335 so I was a little worried at first however when it arrived and I placed the instrument inside I was very pleased!\n",
            "768 For what it is, it is great. Perfect for practice.  Past my days of playing live, now it is just for pleasure.  This amp delivers for that.  Keeps the noise down for others, delivers great sound, takes up almost zero space. Great buy.\n",
            "769 The Amazon advertised pictures of this item is a Fender FTE3 pre amp. The description says it's a Fishman Isys III type. I googled it and found out there's two version of pre amp type of this T Bucket 300 CE series. The one I got today is a Fishman type pre amp which is for me much better that FTE3. Out of the box, I fell inlove with the color and design. Mine is a 3 tone sunburst. The action is just right for me. The tone/sound is awesome. I hooked it up in my Vox amp and I have to say this thing really rocks. Of course you can get a better sounding acoustic/electric guitar out there for a very much expensive price. I'm a family man with two kids and I am not gonna spend a thousand bucks just for a hobby. Amplified or not I love the tone of this baby. For it's appearance, sound quality, and of course THE PRICE, I'm giving it a five stars.\n",
            "770 Awesome. Quite an upgrade for me after only owning cheapo guitar stands all my life. This baby is thick, sturdy, and very difficult to tip over. One thing that's not mentioned anywhere: these stands carry a LIFETIME WARRANTY.\n",
            "771 What I ordered was MSP6100 SP Lifespan 80/20. But what I got was a package of 7050SW with a sticker on the backside reading 6100\n",
            "772 Perfect RGB 86 LED PAR light! Very bright, light weight, sturdy! Fitting well in my music studio set up! I'm gonna order 3 more! (My favorite color is blue:)\n",
            "773 The bag is snug, but works well and has excellent padding for transportation.\n",
            "774 Blends beautifully with the chrome tonearm, and includes the 4g weight which is easily removed.  I am using in conjunction with an Ortofon 2M Red on a 1200Mk2.  Excellent results.  Somehow, although the output level is rated the same between my previous setup (Concorde cartridge with Ortofon Night Club stylus, 5mV spec), I am now getting a proper output level through my preamp, whereas the previous cartridge/stylus was at at least 6dB lower.  Weird.  Tried two different model stylii on the other headshell, another headshell altogether, and they both gave the same result.\n",
            "775 These fit my Schaller strap lock equipped straps perfectly.  Nice chrome coating.  The supplied screws looked a little thin, so I mounted the strap buttons with stainless steel #6 screws.  I'd buy these again for my next project.\n",
            "776 I purchased these stands to hold my Yamaha HS5's. These stands are really well made..heavy and have a nice look to them. I really like the triangle base as it makes it easy for them to fit in the corners of my room. They have locking pins that are great for keeping the stands at the height that you set. They also have some type of rubber feet that helps with leveling the stand. These are pretty impressive. The only thing that I don't like is that the platform that the speakers sit on are a bit larger than i'd like...but this is more my fault for not reading the dimensions. Other than that, I highly recommend these.\n",
            "777 It's built solidly but the tolerances and alignment of the various holes leave a lot to be desired, you have to be somewhat forceful in a few instances in order to get it to stay together straight. Once that was taken care of, there's really nothing to complain about, the unit is reasonably sturdy (don't jump on it, but it will hold your instruments no problem) and it's working very well for me. How well? Look at the picture!\n",
            "778 This is an excellent little stand.  The adjustment for angle is easy to do, and the construction is robust. Quite roadworthy!  It fits my Mesa-Boogie Subway Rocket perfectly, and holds it at just the right angle to make the most of my little amp.  The Boogie is no lightweight either. It is a handbuilt, all tube point-to-point American-Made amp in a robust case.\n",
            "779 This is a great Les Paul like guitar for the novice player. Very minimum setup was needed...6th string buzzed a little. Everyone loves the look. Fun to play at a very affordable price.\n",
            "780 I use this with the Zoom G3n and it works well as an expression pedal. Good value, solid build quality, so far so good.\n",
            "781 Well maybe not \"better\", different but on the same level of awesome sound. I almost want to lie and say they suck so nobody else gets them... The sound is so round and full I couldn't believe it. I started building my own guitars and I will buy more of those soon. Put three on my home-made strat,\n",
            "782 Perfect slide if you want more control over patterns and fingering as you play. The finger you use the slide on can bend and is free to do work as well! Plus the brass keeps it nice and chunky. Ive got small hands for a guy, I wear small to medium gloves, size 8-9 ring finger so based on the product  description I figured this would fit perfectly on my middle finger so I could do slide and chord mixtures. Wont go over my second knuckle on my middle finger which should be around a size 10-11. After trying tons of glass, chrome, and brass full slides, I found this small slide to be perfect for what I play.\n",
            "783 This is very best for me. Soft and safe.\n",
            "784 Well built, all metal construction, It's capable of holding 6 and possibly 7 smaller mics if you use the center mounting hole that goes over the mic stand, you can use a mic clip to hold the bar instead of the washer / nut. I use it to hold 4 large diaphragm condenser mics with shock mounts. It keeps me from having to swap mics for different vocalists when recording.  I just position the pop filter in front of the mic that is being used and mute the unused ones.  Sometimes I'll actually leave the other mics on and record the simultaneous vocal takes across several mics to separate tracks. This gives me several \"flavors\" to add effects to without having the vocalist do individual takes on different mics.  It saves a lot of time when choosing a mic for a particular vocalist.\n",

            "787 This was my first ever attempt to replace a nut and it was an easy job on my Epiphone LP Special P90. I filed down the ends a bit and used a dab of glue to help secure it.\n",
            "788 Looks great! Replaced the stock neck plate on my Squier standard telecaster.\n",
            "789 I like this pedal very much so far. My favorite pedal was a Joyo and it didn't last long. It's in my junk pile. I hate the for the money thing. This delay pedal does a lot more than most one trick ponys out there. Money when you get into Chinese stuff is a gamble, I hope I get some time out of this Joyo because it just that great.\n",
            "790 Great controller. The sound and build quality are very good. Balanced outputs, aux, 4 channels of control, huge responsive jog wheels. This controller also has VU meters for every single channel which is really hard to find at this price point. The low and high pass filters have a nice whisp to them. The only thing I don't like are the feel of the performance pads. They are not pads but more like triggers. Don't get me wrong, they work fine and are responsive but they do not feel like the pads that are on the pioneer ddj for example. They are not velocity pads. Other than that this thing is a beast and well worth the money.\n",
            "791 The price is to good to be true! It blew after light use of 2 years maybe 4 times a year! Started smoking all sound went out and ruined the event! Don't  waste  your money on something that will just blow after light use at very low volumes!\n",
            "792 I starting giving away my other stands after buying 4 of these 6 mos ago - lightweight yet sturdy, stylish and stable.  I'll be picking up 4 more soon.  Based on the build and style of these I also picked up a pair if ID speaker stands and sub poles, which are indestructible!  The Frameworks ID line has my vote!! Here's a few pics from the 2016  GABF festival in Denver...\n",
            "793 I ordered the RODE Podcaster and needed a shockmount that would work with it on the first try. I could have found a cheaper third party solution, but to be honest I wanted my Mic to have the products that were designed for it. That's why I went with the PSM1. It's got a perfect fit for the Podcaster and Procaster mic's. No real complaints from it thus far.\n",
            "794 I purchased this to protect my Jim Dandy guitar when I'm out and about.  It is a parlor sized guitar and needed a fairly snug fit - a regular dread bag was just WAY too big.\n",
            "795 Fits great but the only complaint I have is that the tremolo springs are cheap quality and so is the block that attaches to the bridge. I took it off and put my own on. When you do that though, the wammy bar won't fit.\n",
            "796 This tape worked great for my latest build. Adhesive is strong and the tape accepted solder well with no issues. It's thin enough to form inside cavities well and installation is easy. I would recommend peeling back just enough backing to start one end and then remove the rest as you go. Since the product comes in a pill bottle, it's formed in a tight circle so, if you just hold one end and remove all the backing, it will recoil and stick to itself. Great product!\n",
            "797 Overall, this neck is a good deal. It's straight, level and the wood has nice grain. Everything seems to intonate correctly. It fit my VM Squire Telecaster neck pocket perfectly. I had to file 7 frets to level it, but I guessed that going in.\n",
            "798 This pickup has a great, traditional, single coil strat sound. I'm really pleased with the sweet clear tone this delivers. You can make it scream with your amp setting if that's what you want. It's really great looking, too! I had no issues at all with the soldering connections, and the volume and tone pots work well as does the jack. I used this on a cigar box guitar build, and I love the tone! This homemade CBG sounds like a legitimate strat. I would definitely use this pickup again in the future, and I have no doubt it would sound good to swap out the pups on a cheapo commercial strat with these. My only complaint, and it's a small one, is that the knobs included had a tiny bit of smearing on the gold paint. It's not a big deal because many pups don't include knobs at all, and there are so many knob options available at very affordable prices. I actually used the knobs anyway, so I'm not going to knock a star off for that. The tone and looks of the pickup are fantastic at this price!\n",

            "809 These picks not only look good the are comfortable to use. The seem to have a rounded valley which leaves a raised edged. This helps to keep your finger on the pick and doesn't allow it to move around. In the close up picture you can see a slight curvature. This is the first time I have used these picks. I don't know how they will last but I will have fun finding out. It's a pick. You use it on a guitar. It's not complicated. I think its a very personal choice. But I have really enjoyed using these so far.\n",

            "811 I wasn't able to begin to get this item onto my Shure SM58 without tearing it.  Other reviewers have regarded the tight fit as a feature, but to me it it a big defect.  I take the windscreen on and off as conditions dictate, so I don't want to have a fight on my hands every time I need to make a change.  The picture shows a comparison of a Shure windscreen and this item (note the tear on the right one.\n",
            "812 I've been using this with my new Zoom H1n since I got it, and often times in very windy settings (the beach in particular). This works marvelously, as expected. The fit is perfect and the elastic has just the right about of grab. Other than it being quite large on my little recorder (my kids refer to it as my \"chinchilla\"), it works like a champ at muffling wind noise.\n",
            "813 I used to own a Boss CS-3. This pedal is almost as good for less than 1/2 the price and footprint.\n",
            "814 Good product, though in the 15 I bought there were slight inconsistencies in the angle lock mechanism. It seems the button latch is a little too low to click into place consistently on some of them, but it doesn't affect them in any real way unless you're the type who uses a protractor to angle your instruments just so. Also, if you have smaller headstocks on your guitars or basses, you'll probably need to adjust the width of the holder with channel-locks or something similar that can squeeze the sides together. Still, they look good, even better when mounted on a piece of stained pine, and they hold my guitars and basses nicely.\n",
            "815 Easier to install than I thought! Was a little skeptical because of some reviews... but I guess they were from people who can't follow instructions.... I used the little stick provided and was done in less than 10mins!  Love it!\n",
            "816 I can't see how you could get a better product for the money. This thing is fantastic. The size, man, Donner is really on to something with this Nano design. Around the height of a playing card and half the width. It's tiny but still fully functional for a basic delay/falloff pedal. The tone quality of my Chinese humbuckers through the pedal is great even if I put a distorted signal through it, and the range of adjustment is sure to add some flair to just about any playing style. Build quality is spot on, the plugs are solid, and the quality of the stomp switch would feel right at home on a $100 pedal.\n",
            "817 kinda flimsy but oit does the job\n",
            "818 This is a first blush review and might not be helpful to readers outside of the United States.  I have plugged a variety of pedals into the JP-02 and all powered-up as expected.  The AC plug that goes into the wall or power strip is not designed for standard outlets found in the United States.  While this is not an inherent flaw, it is not stated clearly enough in the item description and I do not believe it can be seen in the photos.  JOYO does include a 2-prong adapter for use in the United States.  The adapter is much smaller than the power supply itself, which leaves the bottom of the power supply resting 1-5/8\" away from the outlet (see attached photo).  There simply doesn't seem to be enough surface contact between the base of the power supply and the outlet.  A few trips over the power cord could easily compromise the integrity of the adapter, AC plug and/or your outlet.  I have not yet decided whether or not to keep this.\n",

            "828 I got mine at a music store, not here, but wanted to give a review. First, it is a $40 uke... so people need to keep this in mind. I got it to play a campfires,  the beach, by my hot tub, etc. I am not expecting  it to sound like wood. Given that, I am very pleased. It is a great novelty item. People say theirs does not stay in tune, but mine does.  I can hang it on the wall and not touch it for several months. It  is still pretty much in tune, with some minor adjustment. But I would expect that from a wooden or more expensive one as well.  I added some miniature lights off Amazon and it certainly serves its purpose.  Enough light to see if I want to play in the dark, and also can be festive as well.  I have never regretted purchasing this.\n",
            "829 Stunned at how clear and full the audio was.  Very easy to use with my iPhone and a free audio recording app (Voice Record).  Then just push the result up to Dropbox.\n",
            "830 Fits my tele build perfectly and looks great!\n",
            "831 This is a good case bought the damaged box one for $30 less from amazon deals had minor and i mean minor barely noticable scratch $30 bux off this is a great durable case not as great as my road runner case but that one cost $125 bux and has a rough plastic molded shell\n",
            "832 It worked well for about a month, and then broke too much to use.\n",
            "833 I like! I'm using the stomp thru a cheap reverb into a 15w bass amp. Going straight, not too impressive but, when ya lightly process the signal, it really pops! I used shelf liner to keep in from moving around when I play. Great for the price!\n",
            "834 Had to drill into my headstock. Needs 2 holes per tree because of the mounting peg. Use a ruler and a 1/16 drillbit and you'll be fine. I recommend installing with the strings on so you can set them properly.\n",
            "835 Not much to say here - they're knobs. They look good, are well made and fit perfectly on the CTS pots in my guitar.\n",
            "836 I have the 7 guitar version of this same stand (which costs less).  As I said in that review, put it together loosely, then, if all is good, tighten it down.  The instructions are OK, just make sure that you read them and identify all the parts (some look alike but are slightly different).  Poor reviews must be by the mechanically challenged.  You get what you pay for - even though the bigger stand costs less - but it works fine.  I have some very expensive instruments in mine with no worries.\n",
            "837 Prefect case for what I have . Thanx Amazon\n",
            "838 I have a newer model build without the coveted LM308 chip so I can't comment or compare it to that but in certain settings it does sound great.  I don't use this as a primary distortion but rather as one of many and I frequently use it in tandem with my DS-1 or Big Muff Pi. I use it to make already distorted sounds even louder and more dirty. The Filter knob should not even have the option of going all the way clockwise. To me, it sounds like piss if you do that.\n",
            "839 These stands are excellent. They are well built and easy to assemble. they come with an Allen wrench and that is the only tool needed. The stand has a nice design when it comes to the base. There are 3 soft rubber pads that come on the stand. They also give you 3 pointed metal spikes that you can put on, which is perfect if placing on a rug. The spikes are adjustable so you can get set for the rug height and get the stand perfectly level. I put a pair of JBL monitor speakers (LSR305) on this stand for my Yamaha piano DGX-650B. See attached pictures. The stands look like they were made to go with this piano.\n",
            "840 I just wanted to say that the Fender Vintage Noiseless Pickups were a great upgrade to my 2012 Fender Standard Stratocaster.  They provide a much cleaner, bell-like tone compared to the factory-fitted pickups.  The factory pickups are actually great for gritty blues and rock, but my playing is mostly clean, so I prefer the sound of the Vintage Noiseless.  Also, the package I got had the updated wiring diagram (correct!) - the only issue is that is didn't show how to connect the output jack hot wire, but it is shown on the wiring diagram from Fender's website (for the American Deluxe Stratocaster).  I installed the new pots, capacitors, resistor that came in the package and this gave me the cleanest, brightest tone.  If you want a warmer tone, you can probably skip doing this.\n",
            "841 I traded for a TMB100 in sea foam green recently and I was pleased with the construction. The wiring is good. After I set it up everything was great. My only complaint is that I had the bass only 24 hrs before the Tone/Bass knob snapped off in my hand, right at the base as I was adjusting the tone, rendering them useless and stuck in their current configuration. I didn't really think I was cranking it that hard. Now I have to buy a $60 preamp knob before my next show and be terrified that I'm gonna snap it off again. tldr: Great guitar. Needs a setup. Be careful with the specific expensive knobs.\n",
            "842 Cool little portable sound amplifier, for when you just got to make noise without waking the neighborhood! Very light, hope it's impact resistant so I can stuff it in a back pack with other goodies. I'm using it for harmonica, slide guitar, or as a powered speaker for my media players. The sound is decent and the battery seem to last long enough. I am happy with this purchase. Way to go Danelectro!\n",
            "843 Nice solid springs and defeinitely more silent. Easy installation and the black looks cool.\n",
            "844 nan\n",
            "845 Every guitarist must have one of these for a dash an play gig. Packed and ready to go. More good sounds than you will ever use in a life time and I also own and use the Eleven Rack and Fractal Audio's Axe-FXII. Check me out at You Tube user/loowood2 or Google LooWood\n",
            "846 Worked for maybe 30 minutes then it died and never came back on. Used standard pedal power supply to power it. What I heard sounded good, but its internals died so quickly. Tried batteries, and other power supplie afterwards. Nothing worked. Refunded and got a Dr. Scientist Pedal and have been amazed.\n",
            "847 Man. No words can not be said. I have a Catalina Maple drum set. Once I placed this head on there and that first hit. It sound like a cannon. Perfect sound. It make you want to play all day. Made me want to start dancing.\n",
            "848 This is my second ukulele. I recieved this as a Christmas gift and I love it. It has very nice strings and has like mother of pearl tuning pegs. With my first uke I had trouble with the strings being hard to tune but right when I got this I tuned within 30 seconds and started playing. Also it comes with a chord chart and songs and a case.\n",
            "849 Exactly what I needed! The wall mounts were extremely inexpensive, are nothing super fancy because I just needed something to hold my stuff to the wall, not to look super expensive and fancy, and work perfectly well. I have three guitars, two of which are in my little \"man cave\" so that I can just grab and play when I feel like it, and one of which is hanging out of reach of my four-year-old because it has sentimental value that she'll eventually learn to stop trying to touch.\n",
            "850 Made well. I'm pleasantly surprised of how pleasant the bells sound, very smooth. I'm using them on  top of my high hat for a little extra sound. I modified them slightly fir my purposes, but think they would be great as regular ankle bells as well.\n",
            "851 Quality is what I need! I was tempted to go with Behringer, but it originates in China, I have already experienced background noise and some power issues with previous versions do I said no. This has been fantastic on the other hand. Got this about over eight months ago, and so far it's been nothing but reliable and still can be used for quality audio. Also, Yamaha derives from Japan so wow, what a major difference. Thank you!\n",
            "852 I ordered eight of these after reading the reviews.  I have five guitars, including two Les Paul's and they hold them just fine.  I give them four stars.  The are fine for, I believe, all guitars at home, but I wouldn't use them for retail or something like a school.  They are made if ABS plastic and at the point where the arms swivel it's just a rivet the holds them together.  The wall anchors that they send with them are a joke.  like the other reviewer said, you really should find a stud to mount them to, but if you must use wall anchors, use the burly moly ones that bore into the dry wall.  All in all these are sturdy and stable (when anchored to a stud) and I'll use more if I have the need.\n",
            "853 This bridge cover is beautiful. It really adds flare and character to your bass. I personally added it to a Squier Bronco bass that I've modded with Mustang parts.\n",
            "854 seems like a very nice case, but quality control is questionable.  Case was damaged from the factory, no damage to the packaging or plastic bag surrounding the case, indicating the damage occured from the factory.  For the amount that I paid for this case I would expect a product in perfect condition.\n",
            "855 You just can't beat these Hohner blues harmonicas in terms of what you get for the money. Very good sound and playablity, durable, and not too expensive but the price does keep going up. I have 7 of them, some go back years and years (I like Lee Oskar harps too, but I prefer the blues harp as it's \"throatier\"). I see some reviewers have complained that it's hard on the lips or is not very durable; don't know where they're comin' from, no problems for me here (I have a bunch of Hohner Pro harps and they do hurt your lips; as for durabilty: only my oldest blues harp, the A, has a reed out, mainly because I played it for years like a 3 lung madman, the others are in perfect condition). If you want a diatonic harmonica that sounds better than this be prepared to cough up in excess of $100, otherwise get this.\n",
            "856 Great item for studio recording this improve my mix. Fast shipping great products\n",
            "857 I went from fender chrome non-locking to fender gold locking. It made my guitar look beautiful and play beautiful. I think locking tuners are the way to go. If you are new to locking tuners look on YouTube for instructions.\n",

The case that these two came in is very durable. The microphones and clips are securely padded within the case, which makes transporting them a breeze . We tested these out and they worked perfectly fine through the PA. The microphones sounded very clean, but on the bass(ier?) side, which can be adjusted if desired. Overall, this is a great buy! It is really awesome that these come as a set and with a nice hard case! In action, they work really well and 100% could be used in a professional setting. Thanks, Audio 2000s!\n",
            "859 They look and work awesome! I bought them to match my gold tuners and they added a smoother tone to my Fender T-Bucket 400ce. Very happy!\n",
            "860 This pickup is a dream come true. Perfect sound and no feedback on string noise. This made my Yamaha Flamenco into a sensual electric Guitar with the sound of the Angels.\n",
            "861 A big improvement over stock pickups on my 1960 Reissue Stratocaster. Lots of high end snap, much less noise, decent balance between pick ups, classic look. Easy to install but does require soldering. The instructions (really just a wiring diagram) could be a bit clearer so be sure and make note of the existing wiring before you des older and remove the old pickups.\n",
            "862 i was expecting extreme brutality but got a pleasant surprise. this pup is super clean no. 1 and distortion is very smooth not at all what expected its warm in tone but has some bite to it. overall i really like this pup. to be honest I was expecting this pickup to be really mid focused but it has a tight punch in the low and the highs are not over bearing either. great pickup would get again!\n",
            "863 I really love the fretwraps, they're really usefull, specially when you need to record something and want a really clean sound, or when you are a bass player that loves the slapping technique. After i got my first set, i liked it so much that i ended up buying it in different colors!\n",

            "865 i was happy with these and have bought second set. They don't sound muddy. And can be over driven well. Overall great pickups for the price.  They are microponic at higher volume. So If you perform live at high volume that might be the only downside to these.\n",

Ive been setting them up on top of my powered speakers and angle them to hit part of ceilings and tops of walls. They are bright so by mounting them like this prevents squinters on the dance floor and you can see the patterns with out the use of a fog machine. They are housed in plastic and are very light. Kids love them and offer a a Big Bang for just a few bucks\n",

            "869 Well I got my guitar a day after it was supposed to be delivered by ups, apparently they called all the drivers back at 7pm. So I got it the next day and it arrived with a broken neck it probably was broken by ups, I feel if they would of delivered it that night then they wouldn't have to unload/load it so much,more chance of it breaking. So I got a replacement and this one is almost perfect but for the volume knob on the guitar makes static when you turn it up or down. Now I knowvthat is a common problem generally on older volume pots but this is a brand new guitar. I'm hoping that it will get better with repeated turning.it still is an awesome deal with the amp and other stuff its a pretty sweet sounding guitar especially for what you pay for it.\n",
            "870 Perfect match up for my Musicman Sterling Ray34 Bass Guitar. Goes with the Abalone Pickguard and Knobs.\n",
            "871 Great product to replace trems on low end guitars. Fit perfectly in my Jackson RR3 early 2000's model. It functions well. Metal and finish are very soft, would be easy to strip threads or break pieces if you're not careful.\n",
            "872 I'll admit that I bought this power supply to see if I could save about $100 on a better known brand so I wasn't expecting it to work that well and figured it was almost as cheap as my OneSpot. I've got about 9-10 pedals on my board so I made sure ahead of time that there would be no special needs.\n",
            "873 I was recommended this particular harmonica by a few players who said \"Buy the Special 20. Its a great Harmonica and it's perfect for a beginner \" so I took their advice and I must say it's Fantastic. Looks and sounds great and I'm s total newbie but I'm having no trouble at all playing single note songs and exercises. I'll most likely purchase one in every key once I'm more confident and skilled with this one\n",
            "874 It nicer than I thought a protects my soprano better than the other bag I had it in, I would recommend it.\n",
            "875 This fits my Martin OMCPA4 with 3.75 inch hole. Its been a really tough find to find a sound hole cover that fits a 3.75 inch hole. Does a great job of reducing feedback problems.\n",
            "876 When I bought my Roland Gaia, I needed another stand, as I already have two keyboards on a double tiered stand, and I think 3 is too much.  The least expensive stand available at \"that other store\" was over $30, so I figured I get something used, or local.  Checking Amazon, I saw this stand, which at the time of my order was $20.00 even.  It seemed like a great value, so I ordered it.  The packaging was a little flimsy, but the stand arrived in one piece and in good condition.  It fit my Gaia perfectly.  The included straps don't work with the Gaia, but the stand holds the keyboard well, and at the right height.  It's a little beefier than stands in that price range, though not as beefy as my 2 tier stand, though that was much more expensive.  This is totally a five star stand at the price I paid, and even at $5.00 more at the time of this review.  For an inexpensive stand, I don't think anyone can do better.  Recommended.\n",
            "877 Fit my 2000 American Standard Telecaster PERFECTLY!\n",
            "878 I had read another review in here from someone using this with the MXL V67G after popping out the existing mounting ring with a flat blade screwdriver, so I took a chance and ordered one for myself.  That guy was 100% correct! I just popped out the existing mounting ring with a flat blade and my V67G slipped right in and could be tighly secured using the black mounting ring supplied with the V67G.\n",
            "879 I play both guitar and ukulele. I bought the chord stamps for both instruments. How nice to be able to make note of unfamiliar chords, easily, right on my music. Saves me from having to constantly look them up. I highly recommend these. Get you some! ;-)\n",
            "880 great item for holding all those guitars\n",

            "884 Worked Great in my kit build.  Had to enlarge the holes a tiny bit as they are ever so slightly larger then the stock that came with the kit.  They still stand a tad proud of the bridge but they do hold the strings well and it makes them easier to remove.  They look fantastic, great buy for the money.\n",
            "885 Used this for my Ron Wood ESP/LTD. I love me skme humbuckers, and this did just the trick. Put a black pickguard on it too so its black on black. I dug how Ryan Key's looked. Dont delay and buy it!\n",

            "889 I needed something to put a karaoke monitor on out front of my DJ setup and on a whim went looking around for a VESA mount for a mic stand. Found one, but also found this, which is 10 times better! This stand is GREAT! It is heavier duty than my speaker stands and the legs when fully opened will stabilize the biggest  monitor you reasonable would put on a VESA mount that size. The small 17\" one I have on it solid. It is hard to tell in the photo but the mic holders do have a slot on the side so wired as well as wireless mikes can slip in, you'll want to use a round head Shure 58 or equivalent so it doesn't fall through. Like others have said the hardware is top notch, adjustments can be tightened down securely, and the monitor and its adapter can be taken off with just 2 thumb screws for transport. Great deal at the 70 price too!\n",
            "890 The arm is extremely short and should be longer\n",
            "891 This one is much more stable than the brand they have at my music studio.  I like this one way better.  The platform is wider and my foot seems much happier.  Yes, it costs more, but it was worth it for me.  Very happy with the purchase.  And it lays flat for easy storage.\n",
            "892 Small but powerful enough. It is well made, pretty basic for a speaker.  I would probably buy another one.\n",
            "893 I gave a cheaper neck a shot. I am blown away by the look of this neck. The stain used is just enough to highlight the grain nicely and the clear coat is darn near perfect. I figured a lot of time would be during the \"adjustment\" phase of the build. Nothing else had to be done once the neck was set and bolted on. What a pleasant surprise since in past builds I'd spent an hour or more getting them set. I've used Fender and Warmoth before that cost 3 times and more than this one. The proof had been in the pudding though. This neck has been on this guitar for over a year now. No problems. I use this guitar as a back up and play it quite frequently on gigs. I buy more!\n",
            "894 This is a fantastic rack and makes my home studio look really professional.\n",
            "895 Nice tuners.  Installed on a strat neck and they are working great. Nice and smooth and has stayed in tune very well. Nothing wrong with these.\n",
            "896 Awesome stand. Best one I've ever had. It's not that heavy easy to carry in maneuver. The push adjustment for the up-and-down is great quick and easy holds really good. Feels like it's going to last a long time without being overly heavy. I really have no complaints thing works great. I did put a counterweight cuz my tube recording mic is kind of heavy.. wish I could buy 20 for 50 bucks. Wish they had a deal for multiple...\n",
            "897 I was surprised of the quality of this mic. I used it for recording sessions and sounded clean. I would definitely recommend to anyone to purchase this product. I did not use the unbalanced cable it came with because I had balanced cables that were better to use.\n",
            "898 Nice guitar.\n",
            "899 I just tested this fog fluid with a 1byone 400W fogger. Two 30 second bursts were sufficient to create enough fog layers for a moody atmosphere in a 2 car garage. This being a hot space I was pleasantly surprised by how long the fog would linger. It would quickly rise to eye level and then just hang there. Another nice surprise was the odor- there is not much of it, but if you step in the middle of a thick pocket it smells like lavender (?) soap.\n",
            "900 Unfortunately I received plastic pins with black dots. Not happy and have to return them.\n",
            "901 Cable quality is great, as usual from monoprice. However, Monoprice used a very sticky tape that left a huge amount of tape-glue on the cable rather than two twist ties or similar..Went through 10 minutes and 3 clorox wipes getting it all (mostly) off. Unusual for them.\n",
            "902 Just got my pedal board yesterday!  I love it.  Before I had my pedals strewn all over the floor.  Now they're organized and easier to use.  The board is larger than I expected b/c I didn't pay attention to the measurements in the description.  But I'm glad I chose this one.  It gives me an excuse to purchase more pedals.  Obviously the stock photo shows many pedals placed really close together which is not realistic considering the cables that are involved.  I'm attaching photos of my board for better reference.  Eventually, as I add more pedals I will place the power supply under the board, but for now I like the blue illumination of the AGP power supply.\n",
            "903 This was supposed to be red tortoise.  It's actually closer to brown tortoise.  Maybe in between red and brown but certainly not what I consider red tortoise. I actually have another guitar in need of a brown tortoise cover so I'm using it on that one so not that big a deal, however will not work on my intended red tortoise guitar.  I've attached pic of the this cover which is on the guitar on the left.  The one on the right is what I consider a proper red tortoise.\n",
            "904 Overall I'm happy with the stand.  I admit I was scratching my head a bit when I was putting it together.  There's more pieces to this stand than others I've had.  Adjusting it is a little bit of a pain because there are 4 different areas that you can loosen and change around.  If you travel and gig a lot, you may want to go with the higher model, the adjustments look a bit easier.  However once all setup, it's sturdy and well built.\n",
            "905 Great price and good quality.  It didn't quite match the radius of my sound hole but it was close enough.\n",
            "906 I have a garage sale piece of junk MIJ hollowbody that I've used Amazon to build for cheap.  It's been a blast and this fit the bill perfectly.\n",
            "907 A great product if you need to connect a guitar to a computer or other USB compatible recording device. The cord is incredibly well made. I would say this is for home-use or hobby recording. It would be wonderful to be used to save song ideas or songs in the making. The connections work just fine and are well made. The cord is nice and long so it's comfortable to sit or stand and play and not feel too attached to a computer. The connection points are nice and sturdy so they won't break. If you are in the market for one of these types of guitar cables, I do recommend this one.\n",
            "908 So i needed a cheap guiar that i could bang into walls and not care, so i got this thinking it would be perfect for the job. Sadly, i fell in love with it even though they sent me the wrong guitar. (Amazon falsely advertised it). I got the brown sunburst (absolutely beautiful) but instead of a white puckguard, i got brown sparkly one. Oh well $10 and 30 minutes later and i can fix that. Anyway. It sounds great for a $125 and plays amazingly.\n",
            "909 I put these in a new bass I built last week.\n",
            "910 Outstanding case!  My H6 fits into this case perfectly.  It is made of heavy duty plastic, which is at least twice as thick at the case that comes with the H6.  Each cut-out within the foam interior is custom sized to fit your H6 and all of the accessories.  The latches are very sturdy.  See picture to get a sense of the size in relation to the standard H6 case.  BUY IT...\n",
            "911 These really tidy up my practice board. I like the little donner pedals and these chain them nicely. I do Velcro them down so at some point Ill have to deal with taking stuff apart but.... oh well.\n",
            "912 Absolutely awesome cables for the money. I've bought a number of these in different colors. The connectors are really decent and the cables are very well made- nice silicone jacket.  I've shortened a number of these LyxPro cables using the original ends for balanced line use in a patch bay.and also using, Neutrix TRS connectors, Neutric XLR's, Switchcraft right angle TRS ends, and even some ends of off some Seismic Audio cables.\n",
            "913 I have worked in radio for over 12 years as well as voiceover.  My main microphone has been the big brother to this one.  Most radio studios you enter use the RE20.  That being said when I recieved this RE 320 I was blown away.  I have done my radio show with it exclusively for the past 8 months and love it!  This mic ROCKS!  This microphone has XLR connections so be sure to use good mixer with those standard connections for a top quality mic like this.  When you first get this microphone you immediately notice the professional look and feel to it.  It is all that you would imagine it to be. Simply put this mic is top quality and produces great sound even without processing.  5 STARS!\n",
            "914 Light is bright, light weight, and small in size. Works great in auto mode and sound activated mode. This light almost goes 360 degrees, and will easily fill a backyard or small hall.\n",
            "915 The Ditto is the best looper I've owned (I've tried a few). It's very easy to use.\n",
            "916 Cool little box, I'm using it with my Arturia Microbrute analog synth, looks cool, sound good, easy to use, fits well in gig bag.\n",
            "917 Installed these humbuckers on my Epiphone Les Paul Standard. The sound of the neck and bridge humbuckers are very similar. The bridge just has a tad bit more treble. However, both of these HBs produce a very, very warm sound. When playing with an MXR Distortion + it produces a grunge/fuzz sound but keeps clarity of each note. The clarity is outstanding on the HBs-each note can be heard. The HBs are not very versatile, only producing a grunge/fuzz sound, regardless of what distortion pedal I use but it fits my playing style at the moment so I am very happy with them.\n",
            "918 If you're looking for a gig bag for a semi-hollow guitar or bass, this will do the job. Make sure you are looking for part number 0991622206 - that's the Metro Gig Bag for Semi Hollow basses.\n",
            "919 This case is awesome!  The molded interior fits my Fender Jazz Bass like a glove and I feel it's secured at all times.  This is the second case I've owned and the quality is superb!  It balances much better in my hand while carrying it than my last case which was a bit front heavy.  It's also lighter in weight than my previous case too.  The open compartment is deep enough to fit my cable, strap, tuner, accessories and I usually throw my amp power cable in there too.  I also like that the open compartment does not have a door that you always have to open or close.  Just open the case and everything is there for easy access.  Lastly, cosmetically this case is very sweet looking.  The black, white and chrome details are perfect and of course the chrome Fender logo on the top of the case really sets it off.\n",
            "920 These sticker pentagrams are real nice. Have some left over and put them on my violin. Badass.\n",
            "921 I installed this kit in my Squier by Fender Vintage Modified Stratocaster. What a great upgrade. The guitar comes with all those tiny pots and cheap electronics. Get yourself one of these kits if your guitar came with cheap electronics. It is a Tone Buster... :) PS I added a few other mods myself.\n",
            "922 I wanted gold jacks, not silver. I've built a Steeler-themed guitar (see photo) and these silver jacks are wrong. Will you exchange it for the gold jacks?\n",
            "923 Works as advertised (I'm sure along with the other 5 or 6 brands out there that are the exact same one- see pic it's the one they shipped). Only thing I'd say is pay attention to your current- everything worked fine except my wireless (line 6). It'd power up but then go dark. Turns out it was plugged into a 100ma port. It needs upwards of 300+ma. Plugged into the correct port and it was fine. So far no issues after about 6 or 7 gigs. I'm surprised because it's priced so cheap. Comes with all the barrel (power) cords (Not the 1/4\" cords). Can't go wrong for under $40.\n",
            "924 I have a 1986 Peavey Patriot made in the usa guitar. It had one cheap string tree that wasn't a roller. These work great! Make sure to drill the holes for any of these trees you are going to install. The included screw cannot handle the pressure of screwing it in. I will add pictures soon. You won't be disappointed. They add incredible sustain to my guitar!\n",
            "925 First of all, I am a HUGE Fender fan. Guitars, amps and especially their pickups.  Second, when it comes to tone, I am very picky. I love the Fender Custom Shop 69s, 54s, 57/62s and Fat 50s. I wanted to try something other than Fender this time, so I chose these SSL-1s. So far I think they are absolutely the best single coil pickup I have ever had. Big, full tone with bell-like highs and a clear bottom end.  On a lot of pickups in Strats the neck pickup can sound too quacky, too much twang and it over powers everything else.  These strike a very nice balance with quack and all the other harmonics that are present.  Some other vintage single coils Ive tried have too much chimey-ness in the tone, too much high, drowns out the mids, again these SSL-1s don't do that, even though there is still tons of chimey, bell-like tones, like glass breaking, very brilliant, but its balanced out with the mid and low tones as well.  Very nice and yes I would buy them again.\n",
            "926 At the Price point and what it deliveres it's a must buy. I play Bass. Only a few things I can gripe about and it's the clarity of the notes not being as clear and the split with the music (aux) and headphones..gotta find the right spot. That said it's built great for plastc...very sturdy..and the fact I can USE AAA batteries and not LITHIUM BUILT IN is what sold me over others too! (Buy your own batteries)  Comes with cheap batteries. The device works so well I can change two batteries but if the built in stop working and it fades away.. device is no good. Nobody knows I'm evening practicing or jamming. Very nice should have baught along time ago. I use Beats headphones and Uiisii Us90 ear buds sold on Amazon..the best earbuds you will find!($10!) Find them!  Why the Beats? I use the cord for aux to phone. But u can get an aux cord ..(preference)\n",
            "927 Fits my Squier Stratocaster (Bullet) great, with a few inches to spare lengthwise.  Theres a ton of great zipper pockets, the handles are great and the padding is pretty decent. I use this for light traveling for my cheaper guitars. In my opinion I would not put an expensive guitar in here as the padding isn't the best, but it will still resist scratches and small bangs but more than likely not drops.\n",
            "928 5 stars. For its price and size, couldn't have asked for more.\n",
            "929 Love it! I have had other tuners & recently bought a pedal tuner. I like this because it's much more convenient. The pedal wears through 9 volt batteries pretty quick, so I'm constantly plugging & unplugging. W/ this one, I just move it from one headstock to another & turn it on/off as desired...\n",
            "930 I have a Martin guitar and Martin strings are the only ones I use.\n",
            "931 This stand is perfect.  For the price, it's hard to see why anyone would settle for cheaper.  The stand is stable and locks the guitar to the stand at the head stock. The locking mechanism senses weight and locks the guitar in place without extraneous adjustments.\n",
            "932 Ordered a \"MUGIG\" tuner, but received one with a \"Musedo\" brand mark. (See photo) Who is \"Musedo\", anyway?! I'm sure I'm correct in my assumption that these inexpensive tuners are mass-produced in China and receive all manner of brand name logos on them.\n",
            "933 This is now the second pop filter I have purchased of this brand, and there has been one significant upgrade that I am jealous that my previous purchase of item didn't have. I have been setting up two separate recording PC's at home, and my son wanted a similar setup as I had. The first filter I had purchased still works and I liked its ease of use. I was pleasantly surprised to see the one thing I disliked about mine had been changed.\n",
            "934 I like these things. Bought 12 of them and Never had a problem. They come with drywall mounts as well as stud screws.  I always put into studs. Mutch safer than lots of stands that can fall over. Great price and solid.\n",
            "935 These were perfect in every way for my application.  I installed these on a MIM stratocaster (I had to drill three holes in the tremolo plate to do so) and they were the correct NARROW string width ( 2 - 1/16\" ) for my application.  I was even able to top-load the strings through the holes where the intonation screws originally fed through, just to piss off the purists.  It worked so well that I am doing the same modification to another of my import strats, but this time with graph tech saddles.  Those ones will work as well, but I have to sand off some injection mold flaws first (although that will be easy as well).  I'm a believer in either brass or graphite when it comes to the break-angles of strings and these were literally perfect.\n",
            "936 First of all these lights look great! The flashing patterns and bright lights really add pazaz to a party or get together as long as the lights are dimmed of course. The LX-5 has a built-in microphone which is used to match up the light flashes to the beat of a song playing, and this works very well as long as your speakers have a subwoofer (built in or external). I listened to some dubstep tracks while using this and I couldn't believe how accurate it was! The lights alternated between each color during the climb, and flashed in a unison strobe at the drop!\n",
            "937 I'm writing several different reviews here on Amazon to inform all of the shoppers that ALL of the low priced scissor arm mic stands on Amazon right now are the exact same model, just branded with the different logo. I actually picked up the \"neewer\" brand one because it said it came with an integrated XLR cable and a shock mount, but it did NOT, even when I exchanged it for another. Even the box said it has those accessories, but none were included.\n",
            "938 The fender modern player stratocaster is a great guitar, I bought this guitar and modified it with chrome pickup covers and chrome knobs, it is a great looking and great sounding, I strongly recommend this guitar.\n",
            "939 Absolutely amazing! I think they are direct knock-off of Seymour Duncan SH-2 Jazz Model Humbucker Pickups. (you can see the same little holes on each of pups) Powerful, bright sound, no noise. My old Johnson LP with ex \"EMG-ish\"  pickups are now fully awake and angry in a good way. Great quality! Thanks everyone for good review.\n",
            "940 Thickest and most durable beater patch on the market. Buy this even if you don't use Aquarian heads. It'll prolong the life of any head!\n",
            "941 I recently got a used, but excellent, Epiphone Junior.  I've been playing for over fifty years and owned many -- many quite fine, costly, guitars. But as others have discovered, these older, P90-equipped Epis belie their cost. They play and sound GREAT.  With one exception: They come with pretty poor tuners.\n",
            "942 I have both Teles and Strats, and they both rite in this case perfectly. The extra storage areas are great, and you don't get outside storage pockets on a hard case.  The case is very well made, durable, and light.  I think the price for this product is a very good value. I know this will suit my needs perfectly!\n",
            "943 These are not bad for the price and have a good feel to them weight wise. I would say beginner sticks for sure but once you get to be a better drummer and you are learning how to make different sounds with your kit like a rim shot. These will snap off fast. It didn't take too long for my son to snap the tip off doing a rim/head hit. if these are for a electric kit, I would give these a 5 star for that perpose\n",
            "944 These are too thin to be effective on their own.  I love these for their color and overall aesthetics.\n",
            "945 This is great. I bought for another reason but used it instead on my hihat and removed the legs which it is meant to do. Its more solid than with legs and less clutter. Now I have to buy another for the original purpose. I love it.\n",
            "946 I've been using this little amp for over a month now and totally love it.  I run it into a small cabinet with a Jensen Vintage C8R4 8-inch ceramic speaker housed in a maple 12\" x 12\" cabinet and it sounds amazing.  If you closed your eyes you would think you were hearing a Fender Tweed combo from the 50's.  I use a delay/reverb combo pedal in the effects loop insert and it's as sweet as the larger setups I have in my main music room.  I use this in my office and it's perfect for the space.  I can't believe such vintage tones can come out of a chip-amp that is as small as a stomp pedal.  If you're looking for extremely high gain, try one of the other Hotone amps like the Legacy British Invasion or Purple Wind.\n",
            "947 Monster grips are a necessity for guitarists and bassists who demand that their pick has a grippy surface! They adhesive on them is very strong and will stick to picksp made of any material. I use them on carbon fiber picks, bone picks, brass pics & horn picks.  I've discovered that they are also handy for other things as well such as pictures and frames on my wall. One monster grip on the back corners of the picture frame will keep them from sliding crooked on the wall!\n",
            "948 It works! This is a nice product I'm happy, however there are some things I noticed but nothing to take much away from the pedal, especially considering the low price.\n",
            "949 Great little set. Practice pads with options!\n",
            "950 <div id=\"video-block-R1A2T6Z40S0PCW\" class=\"a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block\"></div><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"\" value=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C12pR9Hxo%2BS.mp4\" class=\"video-url\"><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"\" value=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/818WJxExxDS.png\" class=\"video-slate-img-url\">This is the Ideal mic and headset for a person starting their own studio. The mic isn't the best I have ever seen but for the price range it sure is good. I was skeptical but the XLR did come in handy. And it is heaps better than any built in microphone for any other webcam, laptop etc. The headphones are excellent, far better than any other headphones you'll get for fifty bucks.\n",
            "951 Judging from the reviews, the quality must be variable, but this one was a quick bolt-on. The neck was straight and even had the correct relief; frets were smooth and will require only minimum hand rolling of the ends. This one had the correct strat heel shape.  It is a beautiful fretboard with lots of character; the inexpensive nut was the right height and easy enough to replace.  I was able to brand it with my logo, give it a few coats of tung oil and put it on a handmade custom ordered offset guitar that I just finished in my workshop. I've ordered another.\n",
            "952 Nice heavy duty drawer.\n",
            "953 Love it. Thick plastic. Good quality ez install.\n",
            "954 Better than or equal to the higher priced competition. I've used the competition product and prefer this one. Plus the remote comes free, can't beat that.\n",
            "955 I was invited to play quasi-Dixieland banjo for a quasi-Dixieland musical (\"The Boy Friend\").  They told me my banjo wasn't loud enough though I thought it was plenty loud. I didn't want to mess with a mike since the sound guys never get that right.  Or with running a DI into the sound board for the same reason.  So I ordered this pickup from Amazon and installed it.  I ran it through a small Crate combo amp (XT65R); it was plenty loud - in fact I'll be cutting it back tonight.  Sound was OK, would probably be better through an \"acoustic amp,\" but it's good enough for the musical.\n",
            "956 Looking at these on a guitar when they don't have a single wrap on the post, I found it hard to believe the strings would even stay on but I have now installed two sets of these on two different guitars. One black set and the other is gold. The first guitar would not stay in tune so I tried these. They have been on for nearly a year now and they totally fixed my tuning problem. The second set I put on my brand new Gibson Les Paul only because the first ones worked so well. Super easy fast string changes with the auto trim feature, and no tuning issues at all. At 18:1 gear ratio they dial in a perfect tune and hold it. I prefer these over Grover or any other higher priced tuners available.\n",
            "957 Superb built quality and sound. Seriously you pay for the Moog name but damn is it built solid.\n",
            "958 I was hoping that these weren't cheap quality-wise, and they're not. They are perfect. Fits awesomely on my Shure SM58 and Peavey PV mics.\n",
            "959 Upgrading from a Numark Mixtrack Pro to this is night and day.  While I didn't buy it off amazon, I've attached my picture of the set up.  Definitely... buy a high quality flight case.  You don't want to haul a $1000 masterpiece and haul this in something that doesn't protect your investment.\n",
            "960 My oldest son and husband are avid guitar players. We have close to 20 guitars in our home both acoustic and electric. Since my son began playing guitar he has gone through at least 6 Capo's. It had become a joke in our family whenever we drove past Guitar Center we would ask our son if he needed a new Capo.\n",
            "961 Really nice product if you don't have a whole lot of money. It sounds a little mid-range e . Other than that it's a nice product.\n",
            "962 These went on my new Strat a day after my white Strat came home. The only reason is for you! Changing strings in no time. Do they do anything else, nope.\n",
            "963 I put this on a Yamaha drum rack. The tubes are rather large and this thing opened just wide enough to clamp on. I was really surprised. When I first opened the packed I was thinking I'd have to send it back, but it works perfectly and the clamp is very secure. I submitted a picture of it installed. It doesn't look like it's on all the way, but this thing hasn't moved in almost a year!! I would highly recommend this product!!\n",
            "964 Truthfully, I had no idea that the even were ukulele capos. But why not? I use them on guitars and banjo, and there are certainly times when you might want to shift key without transposing so you can take advantage of open strings.\n",
            "965 Cheap and effective. You'll need to print your own decals, but it's MUCH less expensive than the 70 bucks some other fool was trying to get out of us. They look great! Fits my Shure mics nice and snug. Will need to play with the SM57 a bit - not much room left to grab the mic with a foam screen. But we'll work through that.\n",
            "966 This happened (check out my picture) in about 3 to 6 months of use. I guess you by cheap, you get cheap results.\n",
            "967 This pop filter works perfect and I like that it's easily adjustable. The images show a all black pop filter but I received a white and pink/purple filter. That's the only reason I'm going to give it 3 starts. Isn't a little strange and everyone always comments on that fact. It kind of throws off the vibe of my booth. I'll be purchasing anyone some time in the future from a different company most likely because I want a black one. Image attached.\n",
            "968 Odyssey 8-Space Rack is great. I put casters on mine to move it around when I need to.\n",
            "969 Sound is clear and crisp, bowl is beautiful and a good weight.  Love the little pillow.  I have not mastered rotation the striker yet, but I am working on it.  It's a great singing bowl. You won't regret your purchase.\n",
            "970 They were right about filling a large room up with fog. I am a DJ and my light show has never looked so awesome. I would gladly give this product a thumbs up for sure. I have found that the best place to set this up is on the floor. The fog raises slowly. Do not set up on your light stand the smoke goes right at the dances. I am learning.....\n",
            "971 Soft material, and good open sound, I play now with mouthpiece #c5 and its like 2,5 on standard mouthpieces\n",
            "972 Awesome display, and covers a large area. Simple menu and many auto/sound activated programs to choose from(with and without strobe). Strap this to a 4Bar or GigBar IRC and add a small fog machine. Ordering another!\n",
            "973 I ordered this for my daughter as a back up. we finally opened it to get it ready and started tightening , the end part broke!\n",
            "974 I though this was gonna be three green packs separate, but came in one green pack. It has all 3 sets but the sets inside are separate in clear plastic for each. The strings themselves are very good. I love these for electric guitar.\n",
            "975 Works with a Heil PR 40 after taking off the bottom cap. In doing this you need to utilize the piece that comes with your PR40 and secure your mic by screwing it to the bottom of your mic after putting it into the shock mount. Would of liked a natural fit without doing this but for the price it can't be beat and works very well.\n",
            "976 I diid an \"All Fender, All Over\" (as much as practical) upgrade to a $190 GFS Xaviere \"Tele\".  It came exceptionally well packaged an absolutely no flaws. Unlike the cover that came with the guitar, this one is non magnetic, which is a good thing. The GFS guitar is mostly vintage specs and this cover fit perfectly. Makes me wonder if some of the other reviewers got knock offs. I always buy original manufacturer stuff when doing a hardware upgrade, especially if it's only a few bucks more. I've had my fill of trying to fit crappy, cheap, import stuff. Don't get me wrong, there is some really good import stuff out there, but you really have to know what to look for and do your homework.\n",
            "977 Work well for a very reasonable price. Arms are padded well, so no damage to the neck or head.\n",
            "978 I love behringer products cheap and reliable...not my favorite distortion but good for the money..\n",
            "979 For the price, it can't be beat. I hadn't picked up a fiddle in 50 years, so I didn't want to invest a lot of money in something I wouldn't use, but I was pleasantly surprised by this instrument. Of course it's not a high dollar violin, but there is nothing wrong with it.\n",
            "980 I own 3 of these Minis.  Quality on this one is the worst. Glue joints at the neck/body were messy. Had a couple of small dings (see photo of one under strings near bridge) but the important stuff is OK ( neck is straight and the bridge is sound). Fret edges are very smooth. Sounds great but not as good as the Ovangkol.\n",
            "981 Okay, the idea is good, but the materials used are inferior. What good is a locking mechanism if the cheap plastic breaks off? The plastic part that the nylon strap is looped through broke clean off, right on stage. Luckily it was right at the end of a song as I played the last chord, and I held onto the guitar so it didn't go crashing down on the stage. But it could have, I was just lucky. Where the strap loops onto the plastic mechanism is the weak link. The locking part is a good idea. Not going to trust this thing with my instruments though. I had an old Ernie Ball spare strap in my case with simple leather ends. I will use it from now on.\n",
            "982 This guitar is far more beautiful in person. The red to gold tones blend so wonderfully and it has a barely visible tiger-stripe/wood pattern effect that I hadn't noticed prior to purchasing it. I got it here for a fraction of the price I was finding it other places. I have had no problems with it whatsoever yet, it plays easily and sounds like I spent a lot more on it than I did. It even arrived sooner than was expected.\n",
            "983 Great cup holder. Very sturdy, easy to clamp on a Pearl cymbal stand, hasn't moved through 50+ hours of rehearsal and performances.\n",
            "984 Fits 8 Chauvet Slimpar 64 RGBA, power cords, DMX board and paperwork in front pouch and misc. supplies in end pouches and nothing is tight. This bag is made very well and has heavy duty zippers. It has 10 dividers that Velcro in and can be moved. The bottom velcros in too for nice padding. At first the bag seemed short inside so I removed the bottom and placed it in properly to get the right height. It also has a nice shoulder strap. Finally a great product. I am now a Phitz fan!\n",
            "985 I purchased this kit to have an organized and efficient way of changing my guitar strings (electric and acoustic). I like that the tools are all organized in one pouch, there are slots for string set(s), so that you never have to worry about being unprepared for a guitar emergency (hence the name \"gig\" mate).\n",
            "986 the anouncement says original fender, but i recieved a emerson pot inside a simple plastic bag, and without the tonecapacitor .... I don't like it.  :( :( :(\n",
            "987 As a \"Starter\"\" guitar or as a legit back-up it's hard to beat the LP-100 for the price.  I was a complete newb when I bought this model 5 months ago - took it to a friend who's been playing for 30 years and he was really impressed with everything about it.  As a result of having such a good time learning on this one I upgraded 3 weeks ago to an Epiphone Les Paul Standard Red Royale Model.  I got the LP-100 back out last night for the heck of it and am Still impressed with it. Had thought about selling it when I got the new Epi LP but I think now I will hold on to it awhile!!  I purchased Black with cream colored trim then swapped out some of the trim for black and blue\n",
            "988 They were perfect! Man i love them....\n",
            "989 When I first pulled this out of the box I was pleasantly surprised. There were quite a few negative reviews, so I was half expecting  it to arrive in pieces. But it was packaged well and already assembled, so I was pretty happy. Once I had it installed on my rack, I noticed the cable holes in the back aren't even punched out! The main reason I bought this was to store my noisy external hard drive.  I can't do that now, so I guess this drawer is just going to hold random crap that I have on my desk.  I'm honestly pretty bummed. I was tempted to give this two stars, but the drawer itself is pretty acceptable for the price. If you don't need to run cables through the back of it,  then I don't see any reason this wouldn't work for you.\n",

The Behringer is a good value  it works fine and has good features / performance for the price  but like other Behringer products I've used, the sound quality / noise / distortion, leave me wanting a better product.

The various tones and behaviors that these strings produce is hard to describe, but it is a situation that very much agrees with me.  You almost have to hear them to really know.  I just got done installing a set of these DR\\'s on a Reverend Thundergun 4 string bass and they sound awesome.  It might be noted that this bass has a 34\" scale neck and string through bridge.  I had no problems with installation or in tuning.  I am pretty much committed to these style of bass strings.  However a word of caution here.

After troubleshooting, I solder out the tone control and switched it for the volume pot that seemed to be shorted out perhaps from too much heat from the ground soldering on the back from the factory. Everything worked but there was still hum that I eliminated by running it through an effects pedal. The second one worked but had overwhelming static and hum, but it was cheap. I wired bypassing the controls, plugged it into a separate volume pedal and into an amp. It works fine now but with a little hum. I may still use these in the future because they are very inexpensive. I would use a better and more expensive pickups on better quality guitars. In the future, for one of my inexpensive projects, I would probably just order the pickup without the wiring harness and controls. But, rethinking, even buying an output jack and a bit of shielded cable at Radio Shack would have been more expensive in the end. You can't beat the price.\", 'Great idea, but unfortunately the clamp doesnt work correctly. You can only adjust it with the tab in the closed position, as opposed to the position shown in the instructions, defeating the easy on/off feature. Also the bracket that attaches the clamp to the cup holder uses a single screw, which loosened up while I was trying to attach the clamp to a mic stand. I was able to tighten it up, but I needed to remove the bracket in order to do so. Further, even after tightening this screw, the bracket still had a tendency to swivel.', \"They're pretty perfect for my violins, but I have to readjust them often\", 'This is a great little gadget.

The rubber grip on top is actually riveted on, so that should last a good while. I also used this for when I practice standing up. I rest my foot on it which pushes the bottom of my guitars out so I can see what I'm doing. All in all its a good product and I recommend it.

I didn't like the Custom Shop Fat 50's that were installed. I wanted something that could growl, that was noiseless but still kept the chime of the king tone and these pickups deliver. I adjusted them a couple of times (not too high) and may have found the sweet spot. I don't change pickups too often but the fat 50's sounded too farty and muffled to my ears. I also like to play a wide range of styles ranging from Jeff Beck jazz to Yngwie Neoclassical to John Mayer blues. These pickups are able to handle those styles easily. Most importantly they are dead silent and that's important when you're doing a lot of recording.\", 'With a much needed modification, this became a far more durable board.', \"Guys, this is a really good sounding pedal.  It has enough highs-lows-mids to make you smile.  The sound is similar to pedals costing much more.  Of course, everything is based on taste and the kind of music you play.  This is not a super scooped metal pedal.  It's best for strong overdrives and smooth grudge sounds.  The big factor about this pedal compared to more expensive pedals is that it doesn't like HEAT.  I had a gig in Detroit on a metal stage with a 100 degree PLUS day.  The pedal didn't like it at all.  My BOSS Blues driver was just fine.  Of course the Blues Driver is a $100 pedal. It took the temps just fine. So, that is, in my opinion, the big difference between what you get with JOYO vs other, more expensive, pedals.  Keep in mind, if you are not playing in 100 degree temperatures you have nothing to fear. So, rock on and enjoy your music!!\", 'Just upgraded to this board and I am very happy I did. I needed more stereo inputs and this one had 4 of them. When it comes to an internet radio station you need a clean quiet board. I have no noise coming out of this board so I am very pleased. Plus I needed the AUX outs for my TelosONE set up. Everything is working perfect!', 'I do wish some reviewers would do a little basic research into what they are buying before posting negative comments. This neck plate is a high quality replacement for the plate that comes standard on newly-manufactured US Strats (and probably Teles). I purchased this to update the look of my \\'97 \"weird, fat logo\" neck plate and am very pleased with the results. The material appears to be aluminum or aluminum alloy with a chrome finish, in contrast to the heavier steel that it replaced. I did not bust out the calipers but it is at least as thick as the older version. It is not plastic, nor pot metal. It comes with screws. For giggles, I stopped by Guitar Center after installing it and yep...all American Standard Strats have this exact same neck plate.', 'This strap is advertised for a mandolin, but I put it on my ukulele. I found guitar straps (usually 2 inches wide) and even dedicated ukulele straps (usually 1.5 inches wide) to be too bulky and uncomfortable. This strap is only 3/8\" inch wide, but my ukulele is so lightweight that I really don\\'t need anything wider and a narrower strap doesn\\'t get in the way of my arms and hands. Installing this strap without removing my ukulele strings took some effort. I had to unthread the strap loop (which is really much tighter than it needs to be), then thread the strap end under my ukulele strings, then thread it back through the strap loop (which is still much tighter than it needs to be). The plastic buckle in the middle of the strap is not removable, so you need to thread that through strap loop and it is a real tight fit. Once installed, the strap works great. The thin soft-ish cotton is more comfortable on my shoulder than thick leather or stiff nylon strap and it doesn\\'t seem to scratch my ukulele wood at all.', \"If you're looking for an inexpensive party light, this is a great option.  The beams are pretty tight and is really set off with a fog machine.  The speaker inside was shocking at first (when you plug it in there is a commanding voice talking about bluetooth connectivity.)  There is a little wireless remote that is useful within 10 feet or so.  The motor is a bit loud but with music playing you won't notice.\", \"I Purchased this unit primarily for sweetening up a violin pickup and an acoustic guitar with an LR Baggs pickup. I'm highly impressed with the improvement in the acoustic guitars tone and character. The parametric equalizer is fantastic for dialing in perfect tone. The unit is dead quiet, the only noise noted was when I tightened up the bandwidth and boosted level into the upper 3rd of its range on the parametric eq. In microphone applications the unit performs equally well and the low cut worked great for reduction of handling noise. This is a fantastic tool at a bargain price. I own an ART tube MP preamp also and this unit is definitely a solid step up from the MP. Thanks to Behringer for making great quality affordable products for musicians on a budget. The only knock I can come up with at this point is that the manual is extremely basic and if you're a new user of mic pre's you're kind of on your own. It would be nice if they had included some application recommendations for basic settings,\", 'I previously purchased the 20\\' cable for my SG and Marshall amp, and I was very satisfied. I have a couple of pedals with different variations that I wanted to incorporate, and the old saying \"If it ain\\'t broke, don\\'t fix it\" came to mind. So I ordered 2 of the 6\\' cables to complete my personal set up. You can\\'t go wrong with these. Great Cords!', \"Love this stuff so far. Looks awesome and I can definitely hear the difference acoustically. Hoping I don't run into the blue / green issue that other reviewers have seen.\", \"Love the beefy strings.  Depending on the style of music you play, you might want to give the heavier strings a spin around the block.  If you're on full-tilt distortion all the time, you probably won't see a difference, but if you play without a lot of pedals and like that slightly crunchy breakup to come from your amp, the Beefy strings can make a big difference.\", \"Another update.

I read negative reviews saying that the quality was crap and it took them an hr to get it threaded onto the base. Unless you have no basic knowledge of being handy this will not be a problem just make sure you find a stud on the wall and screw the included screws through the drywall and securely into the stud. Before you do this  run the  screw that attaches to the base through the threads to avoid any issues like the negative reviewer had. After you attach the base to the wall thread in the guitar hanger screw firmly and you are good to go. I personally would easily buy one of these for the price of 2 they are great quality for the price and if you have more than one guitar to hang then this product is a must buy!!!!', 'I purchased two of these to hang guitars in my music room. These are well made and certainly do the job okay. However, I completely did NOT trust the two skimpy screws they provided to hang this unit. They are basically drywall screws, but these have a rather skinny diameter. I was not about to trust my vintage P-Bass to a skinny screw inside a hollow-wall fastener. No, I used a heavier \"construction screw\" directly into a wall stud. See photo. I was seriously concerned that the supplied skinny screw would actually break off in the stud. If you are hanging a lightweight acoustic, then the supplied hardware should be fine. I\\'m probably just being paranoid and overly cautious.  Other than that, I like it (tho walnut piece could be a little bigger in my opinion).', \"Great, lightweight product that easily replaces some of my older lighting that's nearly eight times the size and weight.  Having two synced with a DMX cable easily fills the room.  The extra colors not available in many of the big name lights is great addition (orange, purple and white).  Only time will tell how reliable they are.  I'm not a big fan of the white house (which glows), but aside from that, they're perfect.\", \"Bag itself seems to be nice enough, certainly the stand fits. The strap failed me and broke upon first use, not even with heavy weight in it. The carabiner slipped out of the socket thing. I don't know how to explain it, all I know is I had to replace the strap altogether.\", \"I bought this bcos it was cheap. The fastener is difficult to unclip due to its tiny size. I have small hands. I like it better if the strings are shorter, so it won't dangle.

Never did I ever heard any strange sounds of feedback or popping or screeching. It was quiet and perfect for me even when I played it real close to the amp. I did not purchase the DC adaptor, just relying on batteries. Imagine I could play electric guitar in my car, how portable is this thing! The bad thing about this is that the box packaging looks cheap and printing was bad. The brand name of the amp is located at its back, kind of shy of telling others it's Fender. At first I suspected it was fake. However the sound doesn't lie.

So I use one of these Alaska Pik Fingerpicks over my index finger for strumming. Size is important. I have medium sized hands, and these picks can slip off my fingertip when it's hot and muggy, like when I'm playing at an outdoor market. That can cause some awkwardness when trying to strum, sing and keep the pick from flying off my finger. I might try the next size smaller in the future.

This one was one continuous piece, and only a few nubs fell out. Ok, lets test it out. I attached it to itself and pressed it together. Nice grip. Then I pulled it apart, and several bunches of nubs came tearing out as well. If I'm going to attach something to my pedal board that will bond permanently, I don't want  something that will tear itself apart and leave bald patches every time I move a pedal.

I was looking for a hard case that had a pair of backpack straps, which this model does. I don't know if all the colors have that, but I was told that the red, white and champagne colored cases have the removable backpack straps. The straps are also nicely padded.

I put a set on and broke a g string within 2 days of moderate use. It snapped near the saddle, so I didn't think much of it. I replaced the set, and within a few more days I noticed that the wrapping on the g string was broken and becoming unraveled near my third fret.

I have a rack mounted digital recorder, a CD player and a small digital recorder. The 100mkII is also a very good recorder but I have some complaints: The battery life is short maybe because it uses only 2 cells.

Apart from these minor details I'm well satisfied with the product.\", \"These wall hangers are superb. I don't understand why others of inferior quality cots twice as much. These are made out of solid wood (looks like Pinewood) glazed over with weather protective urethane. The great thing about this is that it supports all sizes of guitars, from small Ukuleles to full size. That is due to the rubber rings which they include to avoid smaller necks falling out. Another very nice thing is that the arm is screwed into a wood nut, which makes it super secured while allowing for movement in case you have odd neck shapes (like fender strats) which require a little angle.\", \"Purchased the 5-hole pickguard in eggshell for my MIM Baja Telecaster. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much since I hated the cheap, white plastic version that came stock. Black Bakelite looked good, gold anodized aluminum looked better, but somehow this one just seems right. It's a heavy, vintage thickness, rigid, and very high quality.

It also only came with 2 screws instead of the 4 needed. I had the four screws that came with the guitar anyway, from the plastic jack plate I was replacing, so that was no problem either.

Another thing is that she *loves* the look of the Super 55 Deluxe; puts her in the mood for that 40's/50's jazz stuff she does so well :) Overall - we are very happy with the Super 55 Deluxe and I will probably get a second one for myself soon.\", 'Great Product, but there is no warranty in the USA when purchased from Amazon.', 'these capos are easy to use, high quality materials, flawless mecanism, adjustable pressure, an investment for a life.

This guitar is VERY playable--fits well in my hands and has nice low action. I really like the sound it puts out and it DOES stay in tune contrary to the negative comments I read to the contrary.

I read comments saying that the green wire goes with the red and the white is hot. Mine came with the red wire as hot, and I didn't change that. It works, and it definitely sounds like a beige pickup is supposed to, so it think you should just trust whatever setup the factory gives you. Also, I know other people explained this, but many said they had to enlarge the pickup hole to accommodate the pickup. You DO NOT.

I did kind of dent the inside of a gold one as I put it on my squire, so you do have to be careful when installing.

Pop's (when fresh) is the stickiest. Nyman is hard and powdery. Kolstein is very sticky and there is almost no powder at all. There is something special in their formulation. I believe Kolstein includes wax in their rosin recipe, which keeps dust from forming. The other benefit of Kolstein is that it lasts for a very long time on the shelf. Pop's will dry out in less than 2 years. Some people will only use Pop's for a few months before throwing it away. I go back and forth between Kolstein and Pop's. I still can't decide which is my favorite. But them both and try it out.\", \"So far so good. Never heard of Lazarro and who cares? The saxophone can perform. The brand doesn't matter.

Mine came with Lazarro reeds 2 1/2 strength and now I use D'Addario Select Jazz reeds 3S and it does the trick.  If you know how to take care of the saxophone it'll last. Well worth the investment.

My daughter has a cheaper soprano uke and the Cordoba has a noticeably clearer sound and is much lighter weight. It just feels great in my hands. I tried some no-drill straps, but ultimately chose to add a strap button with no problem. I saw some reviews about quality control issues on the finish, and I did find a rough spot on the back (see photo). This was not an issue for me, but I'd suggest checking for this.

This produces a naturally smooth sound that you can get with your nails.  I got the medium size. They fit great on all my fingers but I might try the larger version for my thumb but the medium works great if you bend the plastic back and it makes it looser around the thumb.', \"Great product and price. I bought these panels for a home studio, mostly for mixing a tracking as I don't do much live recording there. There is definitely a difference and the early reflections from the monitors are lessened (to my ears anyway). They did the job I needed and they look good too!

Great if you want to do some recording in an area that is not sound treated that you can't get away with using a condenser microphone in.  It has a lot of character as it's frequency response is far from flat.  Attenuation of the lows and a pretty beefy boost in the presence without going too bright.  It's a bit louder that the Shure sm58, but not hugely.  Still needs quite a bit of preamp, about 70% up on my preamp to remain in unity on my mixer for reasonable recording levels.  It's got a good sound to it.  I think it's super short sighted of Behringer to fail to include the frequency profile of this microphone on the Amazon store page, but don't worry I've got you all covered.

I have an old Ibanez RG that I just didn't want to fuss with as far as tuning adjustments. Installed this with an extra spring and really tightened up the claw into the body, works as advertised. The coolest part is how you can set your bridge height before the final claw adjustment. Can still dive if I want but I'm just having fun playing the RG again in alternative tuning. I can go from 1/2 step down Van Halen right back up to standard leads w/o having to access the cavity.

You can have 1 or 2 lines of harmony, and you can chose whether they are each higher or lower, and between a 3rd and a 5th or the root note. The ability to control those factors makes a world of difference.

When I inserted the battery into the receiver, one of the battery contacts broke off.  Here are some pictures of the receiver mounted on my EOS 6D and a picture showing the broken contact wire.  The battery holder has a bad design because the contacts are weak wire loops and the battery fits very snug and puts a lot of pressure on these weak contacts.

They work with Schallers so you don't have to worry about compatibility and I guess they'll be covered up when I'm playing out, so it's not really that big of a deal but I'm still kind of disappointed. They're also quite a bit bigger but I'm not sure if I hate this, obviously I'm used to smaller Schallers however the larger washer means a more secure connection with my strap and more gold flair. I dunno, I'm still too disappointed with the discoloration.\", \"Awesome bass. I love it. As some other reviewers have commented this bass is not balanced as a standard solid body bass. the neck is definitely heavier due to the hollow body, but you know, that's the way it goes. I love the sound the hollow body gives you sounds a bit like my acoustic bass. The controls give a nice variety of sounds. I am something of a novice player but wanted to add a hollow body bass to my small collection and this Hofner replica is just the ticket. I think I might replace the strings that it came with as they sound a too metallic for my taste, but they are playable and hold tune well. I was able to play this bass right out of the box once I tuned it. No need for adjusting and didn't have that fret buss some reviewers have commented on. I did notice the neck is slimmer and the strings are closer together than any of my other basses, so that is an adjustment, but didn't take long to get into the swing of things. Fun to play and lightweight. Recommended.\", 'Mine were very stiff and hard to tune, no smoothness, like there was dirt or grit in the gears.

It's so much more secure than the sticky back stuff.\", \"This pair of Samson GT Studio Monitors was a great start for me, they aren't your loudest speakers, but they still pack a punch. They can still be mixed on, and give a good all around frequency response. What you want to be careful of is the bass, and mixing bass on these because they will not provide all of the bass that is really there. They are great for mids. The portability is amazing! Along with the fact that you will NOT need an audio interface with these! The Mic plugs directly into the speaker! What a easy and accessible way for an artist to record his vocals, or for a guitarist to to record his notes. Definitely a good investment!\", \"This box does everything I need it to. It's passive, so it doesn't color the sound, it makes for easy switching between my two sets of monitors, and even has an auxiliary input (RCA connection) with separate volume control (which I use to patch in an xbox. Gotta take 5 from working every once in a while!). The main volume knob is really smooth and has some slight resistance, which makes it feel great when dialing in levels.\", \"Deep tone and I'm a fan!\", \"These speakers sound great! I've had a pair of cube Auratone reference monitors for 30 yrs that still sound great but these iLouds are another level. Strong bass, crystal clear mids and highs. They are computer speakers on steroids! The pairing of inboard amp matched perfectly with the drivers makes sure you are getting great sound. They are Bluetooth capable too which I didn't even notice at first because it isn't stated loudly on the package. They aren't inexpensive but neither are good microphones and guitars. If you can afford the price, you will be pleased. Luckily my girlfriend gave me mine for Christmas :) Thank You Love!\", \"Great value for a hard case, holds lots of guitars, including jaguar, or even a Les Paul.

It fits in your hand and is a decent output of light. It is dmx which we all know is awesome! Dmx makes the world a little easier to control! The colors are red green blue and white. The only thing I do not like is the way the colors are mixed, you can see the outside of the color when you mix them. I would put one quad led in the fixture so it's all under one lense and there's no bleeding. But other than that this fixture is awesome!\", \"I've used this for 3 years every Halloween and it always has worked well for me.  After each use, I rinse the tank out with distilled water, then run the unit until just steam comes out, then I dump the water and store the unit dry.

I'm using it with an antique German lute guitar (wandervogellaute), and the stained glass pattern complements the carved rosette of the sound hole in a vaguely ecclesiastical motif -- while still looking a little hippie.  The lute guitar is extremely lightweight, so I can't speak to how well the strap would hold up a heavy solid body electric guitar, but it seems to be very sturdily made, and is definitely comfortable.\", 'I really like the simplicity of this bridge. It adjusts easy for string height and length. It comes with all the mounting screws and even a small allen wrench to make the height adjustments. The provided mounting screws are Phillips head screws. The one thing that I missed when I ordered this was the fact that it is not a bridge for string-thru the guitar body placement. The strings dead end to the stop-flair of the plate. I included a picture of this so it may help to make others aware that it is not for string-thru applications. No biggie tho for me, I will use it on another project now.', 'They are nice picks but much smaller than they appear in your photos!', \"Perfect fit on my 2016 Gibson Les Paul Studio Faded.

I was pleasantly surprised to see the one thing I disliked about mine had been changed. The mount that attaches to your desk has received an upgrade, allowing for a tighter fit on the boom arm stalk, and a more robust build of the mount overall. My previous mount had a D-shaped hole the boom arm stalk slipped into, which allowed for a lot of movement regardless of how tight you made the clamping screw. It was also equipped with an oversized plastic wingnut for securing the mount to the desk. The upgraded mount rectifies both those issues.', \"I received this pedal as a gift.  A compressor is a subtle effect, but it has made a great addition to my pedal board.  The construction of the pedal is solid.  It adds character to chords and enhances leads.  I am currently using the pedal with the sustain at 1 o'clock, the attack at noon, and the volume at 10 o'clock.  The volume provides a very strong boost after 11 o'clock.  Overall, good pedal for the price.\", 'I wanted something light and compact that can hold a few items, but also fit well in a carry-on and protect the jamstik indoors or out.

The wood I received looked outstanding and all the parts were there and fit well. I did some customization to the look and added a couple of other pickups for some diversity but the components I received were of reasonable quality. The guitar looks and plays great after a bit of neck adjustment and setup. Very satisfied.', 'There are only a few things I needed to know before I purchased this Alto/Tenor stand.  1.

It timely arrived. The center mike holder opening is for a much larger microphone than the ATR 2100, that I own. The 2100 indicates 51mm, but that is at the mike area, not the trunk which is much smaller and used for mounting to the shock mount. After researching a replacement in the same price range, I found none. I had some foam pipe insulation for 1/2 inch pvc pipe in the utility room. This is readily available from most any big box hardware store.  I cut the foam about 4\" in length and placed the 2100 in the foam. It fits perfect. I didn\\'t seal the foam, but it is just right and tight in the mount holder. I now have a shock mount that can be used if, and when, I purchase a larger microphone. I have attached a photo.

Strap itself is really soft, so it doesn't irritate your shoulders and neck while you're playing your guitar. It adjusts pretty easy to your desired length. Buckle is plastic. You may or may not have an issue with that. I personally didn't. It looks amazing, and that's putting it kindly. I've gotten many compliments on it already. Definitely worth the money.

If you can play and have a decent amp - you can get a variety of great sounds out of this little box. It seems like so many players like a fuzzy, buzzy type overdrive sound.

I gave it to my guitar player to use and he was very impressed with the improvement in the product, having used other 9 volt practice amps in the past.  Can easily be used to amplify any personal sound needs by using or purchasing a 1/4\" input adapters.

It kept falling over. This mic stand was sold to hold the darn thing but it only works if you place the Isolation Shield in a certain direction (see picture). You must remove the rubber pads that are on the Microphone shield, if you don't you'll find your Isolation shield on the floor! The weight is too heavy for the rubber pads to hold them up (they are glued on). So you have to tighten metal to metal to hold the shield in place. You have to constantly check the tightening supports to make sure they don't pull the support stand down with it! You also have to remove the bottom metal desk supports from the Mic Shield to lighten the load on the Mic Stand. I hope this helps everyone using this for a Mic Shield.\", 'NICE..

Probably not the application intended by the mfg, as they are intended to replicate active metal pickups. The Neck pickup is pretty dark, and lacks volume and clarity. The bridge pickup is louder, and brighter than the neck. I've had both better, and worse pickups... these are just alright. If I had it to do all over again, I probably would have just left the stock pickups in the guitar.

This might be winning me over. The bass boost is outstanding. The active pickups really allow you to adjust to the sound you want. I recommend this for anyone. If you're a beginner  like I was not too long ago, it's an excellent bass to start with. If you're on tour and/or music is making you money, this bass will be beatiful on stage.

Included was additional parts to add a 6th guitar to the stand, which I needed. Very easy to configure the spacing, and load the guitars, stable.

I looked around at the various tie systems available and I bought the Diamond Secure Classical Guitar String Ties because I liked the size. The result was what I needed; B and E1 don't slip with the ties and they stay in tune. I did a double loop with E1 as suggested in the instructions, just to be sure. I was concerned about the appearance of the Ties, but I am satisfied with the look. The Ties are small and have an unobtrusive,  neat appearance.  The attached picture shows my first effort with the Ties. In terms of sound or effect on the guitar I don't hear any difference, but the Ties do simplify the process of tying on strings.\", \"Excellent budget 7 string , Had to touch up the fret work a bit and tighten down some of the screws but other than that it was perfect .

So, I took it and put it on my Ibanez AS93 (a fairly heavy guitar for being semi-hollow) and they fit, perfectly. I had just done a string change and spent a little over an hour playing and breaking the strings in, this strap is super comfy (especially for not being padded).

This homemade CBG sounds like a legitimate strat. I would definitely use this pickup again in the future, and I have no doubt it would sound good to swap out the pups on a cheapo commercial strat with these. My only complaint, and it's a small one, is that the knobs included had a tiny bit of smearing on the gold paint. It's not a big deal because many pups don't include knobs at all, and there are so many knob options available at very affordable prices.

It seems the button latch is a little too low to click into place consistently on some of them, but it doesn't affect them in any real way unless you're the type who uses a protractor to angle your instruments just so. Also, if you have smaller headstocks on your guitars or basses, you'll probably need to adjust the width of the holder with channel-locks or something similar that can squeeze the sides together.

The tone quality of my Chinese humbuckers through the pedal is great even if I put a distorted signal through it, and the range of adjustment is sure to add some flair to just about any playing style.

While this is not an inherent flaw, it is not stated clearly enough in the item description and I do not believe it can be seen in the photos.  JOYO does include a 2-prong adapter for use in the United States.  The adapter is much smaller than the power supply itself, which leaves the bottom of the power supply resting 1-5/8\" away from the outlet (see attached photo).

Also, the package I got had the updated wiring diagram (correct!) - the only issue is that is didn't show how to connect the output jack hot wire, but it is shown on the wiring diagram from Fender's website (for the American Deluxe Stratocaster).

If you travel and gig a lot, you may want to go with the higher model, the adjustments look a bit easier.  However once all setup, it's sturdy and well built.\", \"Great price and good quality.  It didn't quite match the radius of my sound hole but it was close enough.\", \"I have a garage sale piece of junk MIJ hollowbody that I've used Amazon to build for cheap.  It's been a blast and this fit the bill perfectly.\", \"A great product if you need to connect a guitar to a computer or other USB compatible recording device. The cord is incredibly well made. I would say this is for home-use or hobby recording. It would be wonderful to be used to save song ideas or songs in the making. The connections work just fine and are well made. The cord is nice and long so it's comfortable to sit or stand and play and not feel too attached to a computer. The connection points are nice and sturdy so they won't break. If you are in the market for one of these types of guitar cables, I do recommend this one.\", 'So i needed a cheap guiar that i could bang into walls and not care, so i got this thinking it would be perfect for the job. Sadly, i fell in love with it even though they sent me the wrong guitar. (Amazon falsely advertised it). I got the brown sunburst (absolutely beautiful) but instead of a white puckguard, i got brown sparkly one. Oh well $10 and 30 minutes later and i can fix that. Anyway. It sounds great for a $125 and plays amazingly.', 'I put these in a new bass I built last week.', 'Outstanding case!  My H6 fits into this case perfectly.  It is made of heavy duty plastic, which is at least twice as thick at the case that comes with the H6.  Each cut-out within the foam interior is custom sized to fit your H6 and all of the accessories.  The latches are very sturdy.  See picture to get a sense of the size in relation to the standard H6 case.  BUY IT...', 'These really tidy up my practice board. I like the little donner pedals and these chain them nicely. I do Velcro them down so at some point Ill have to deal with taking stuff apart but.... oh well.', \"Absolutely awesome cables for the money. I've bought a number of these in different colors. The connectors are really decent and the cables are very well made- nice silicone jacket.  I've shortened a number of these LyxPro cables using the original ends for balanced line use in a patch bay.and also using, Neutrix TRS connectors, Neutric XLR's, Switchcraft right angle TRS ends, and even some ends of off some Seismic Audio cables.\", 'I have worked in radio for over 12 years as well as voiceover.  My main microphone has been the big brother to this one.  Most radio studios you enter use the RE20.  That being said when I recieved this RE 320 I was blown away.  I have done my radio show with it exclusively for the past 8 months and love it!  This mic ROCKS!  This microphone has XLR connections so be sure to use good mixer with those standard connections for a top quality mic like this.  When you first get this microphone you immediately notice the professional look and feel to it.  It is all that you would imagine it to be. Simply put this mic is top quality and produces great sound even without processing.  5 STARS!', 'Light is bright, light weight, and small in size. Works great in auto mode and sound activated mode. This light almost goes 360 degrees, and will easily fill a backyard or small hall.', \"The Ditto is the best looper I've owned (I've tried a few). It's very easy to use.\", \"Cool little box, I'm using it with my Arturia Microbrute analog synth, looks cool, sound good, easy to use, fits well in gig bag.\", 'Installed these humbuckers on my Epiphone Les Paul Standard. The sound of the neck and bridge humbuckers are very similar. The bridge just has a tad bit more treble. However, both of these HBs produce a very, very warm sound. When playing with an MXR Distortion + it produces a grunge/fuzz sound but keeps clarity of each note. The clarity is outstanding on the HBs-each note can be heard. The HBs are not very versatile, only producing a grunge/fuzz sound, regardless of what distortion pedal I use but it fits my playing style at the moment so I am very happy with them.', \"If you're looking for a gig bag for a semi-hollow guitar or bass, this will do the job. Make sure you are looking for part number 0991622206 - that's the Metro Gig Bag for Semi Hollow basses.\", \"This case is awesome!  The molded interior fits my Fender Jazz Bass like a glove and I feel it's secured at all times.  This is the second case I've owned and the quality is superb!  It balances much better in my hand while carrying it than my last case which was a bit front heavy.  It's also lighter in weight than my previous case too.  The open compartment is deep enough to fit my cable, strap, tuner, accessories and I usually throw my amp power cable in there too.  I also like that the open compartment does not have a door that you always have to open or close.  Just open the case and everything is there for easy access.  Lastly, cosmetically this case is very sweet looking.  The black, white and chrome details are perfect and of course the chrome Fender logo on the top of the case really sets it off.\", 'These sticker pentagrams are real nice. Have some left over and put them on my violin. Badass.', 'I installed this kit in my Squier by Fender Vintage Modified Stratocaster. What a great upgrade. The guitar comes with all those tiny pots and cheap electronics. Get yourself one of these kits if your guitar came with cheap electronics. It is a Tone Buster... :) PS I added a few other mods myself.', \"I wanted gold jacks, not silver. I've built a Steeler-themed guitar (see photo) and these silver jacks are wrong. Will you exchange it for the gold jacks?\", 'Works as advertised (I\\'m sure along with the other 5 or 6 brands out there that are the exact same one- see pic it\\'s the one they shipped). Only thing I\\'d say is pay attention to your current- everything worked fine except my wireless (line 6). It\\'d power up but then go dark. Turns out it was plugged into a 100ma port. It needs upwards of 300+ma. Plugged into the correct port and it was fine. So far no issues after about 6 or 7 gigs. I\\'m surprised because it\\'s priced so cheap. Comes with all the barrel (power) cords (Not the 1/4\" cords). Can\\'t go wrong for under $40.', \"I have a 1986 Peavey Patriot made in the usa guitar. It had one cheap string tree that wasn't a roller. These work great! Make sure to drill the holes for any of these trees you are going to install. The included screw cannot handle the pressure of screwing it in. I will add pictures soon. You won't be disappointed. They add incredible sustain to my guitar!\", \"First of all, I am a HUGE Fender fan. Guitars, amps and especially their pickups.  Second, when it comes to tone, I am very picky. I love the Fender Custom Shop 69s, 54s, 57/62s and Fat 50s. I wanted to try something other than Fender this time, so I chose these SSL-1s. So far I think they are absolutely the best single coil pickup I have ever had. Big, full tone with bell-like highs and a clear bottom end.  On a lot of pickups in Strats the neck pickup can sound too quacky, too much twang and it over powers everything else.  These strike a very nice balance with quack and all the other harmonics that are present.  Some other vintage single coils Ive tried have too much chimey-ness in the tone, too much high, drowns out the mids, again these SSL-1s don't do that, even though there is still tons of chimey, bell-like tones, like glass breaking, very brilliant, but its balanced out with the mid and low tones as well.  Very nice and yes I would buy them again.\", \"At the Price point and what it deliveres it's a must buy. I play Bass. Only a few things I can gripe about and it's the clarity of the notes not being as clear and the split with the music (aux) and headphones..gotta find the right spot. That said it's built great for plastc...very sturdy..and the fact I can USE AAA batteries and not LITHIUM BUILT IN is what sold me over others too! (Buy your own batteries)  Comes with cheap batteries. The device works so well I can change two batteries but if the built in stop working and it fades away.. device is no good. Nobody knows I'm evening practicing or jamming. Very nice should have baught along time ago. I use Beats headphones and Uiisii Us90 ear buds sold on Amazon..the best earbuds you will find!($10!) Find them!  Why the Beats? I use the cord for aux to phone. But u can get an aux cord ..(preference)\", \"Fits my Squier Stratocaster (Bullet) great, with a few inches to spare lengthwise.  Theres a ton of great zipper pockets, the handles are great and the padding is pretty decent. I use this for light traveling for my cheaper guitars. In my opinion I would not put an expensive guitar in here as the padding isn't the best, but it will still resist scratches and small bangs but more than likely not drops.\", \"5 stars. For its price and size, couldn't have asked for more.\", \"Love it! I have had other tuners & recently bought a pedal tuner. I like this because it's much more convenient. The pedal wears through 9 volt batteries pretty quick, so I'm constantly plugging & unplugging. W/ this one, I just move it from one headstock to another & turn it on/off as desired...\", 'I have a Martin guitar and Martin strings are the only ones I use.', \"This stand is perfect.  For the price, it's hard to see why anyone would settle for cheaper.  The stand is stable and locks the guitar to the stand at the head stock. The locking mechanism senses weight and locks the guitar in place without extraneous adjustments.\", 'Ordered a \"MUGIG\" tuner, but received one with a \"Musedo\" brand mark. (See photo) Who is \"Musedo\", anyway?! I\\'m sure I\\'m correct in my assumption that these inexpensive tuners are mass-produced in China and receive all manner of brand name logos on them.', \"This is now the second pop filter I have purchased of this brand, and there has been one significant upgrade that I am jealous that my previous purchase of item didn't have. I have been setting up two separate recording PC's at home, and my son wanted a similar setup as I had. The first filter I had purchased still works and I liked its ease of use. I was pleasantly surprised to see the one thing I disliked about mine had been changed.\", 'I like these things. Bought 12 of them and Never had a problem. They come with drywall mounts as well as stud screws.  I always put into studs. Mutch safer than lots of stands that can fall over. Great price and solid.', 'These were perfect in every way for my application.  I installed these on a MIM stratocaster (I had to drill three holes in the tremolo plate to do so) and they were the correct NARROW string width ( 2 - 1/16\" ) for my application.  I was even able to top-load the strings through the holes where the intonation screws originally fed through, just to piss off the purists.  It worked so well that I am doing the same modification to another of my import strats, but this time with graph tech saddles.  Those ones will work as well, but I have to sand off some injection mold flaws first (although that will be easy as well).  I\\'m a believer in either brass or graphite when it comes to the break-angles of strings and these were literally perfect.', \"First of all these lights look great! The flashing patterns and bright lights really add pazaz to a party or get together as long as the lights are dimmed of course. The LX-5 has a built-in microphone which is used to match up the light flashes to the beat of a song playing, and this works very well as long as your speakers have a subwoofer (built in or external). I listened to some dubstep tracks while using this and I couldn't believe how accurate it was! The lights alternated between each color during the climb, and flashed in a unison strobe at the drop!\", 'I\\'m writing several different reviews here on Amazon to inform all of the shoppers that ALL of the low priced scissor arm mic stands on Amazon right now are the exact same model, just branded with the different logo. I actually picked up the \"neewer\" brand one because it said it came with an integrated XLR cable and a shock mount, but it did NOT, even when I exchanged it for another. Even the box said it has those accessories, but none were included.', 'The fender modern player stratocaster is a great guitar, I bought this guitar and modified it with chrome pickup covers and chrome knobs, it is a great looking and great sounding, I strongly recommend this guitar.', 'Absolutely amazing! I think they are direct knock-off of Seymour Duncan SH-2 Jazz Model Humbucker Pickups. (you can see the same little holes on each of pups) Powerful, bright sound, no noise. My old Johnson LP with ex \"EMG-ish\"  pickups are now fully awake and angry in a good way. Great quality! Thanks everyone for good review.', \"Thickest and most durable beater patch on the market. Buy this even if you don't use Aquarian heads. It'll prolong the life of any head!\", \"I recently got a used, but excellent, Epiphone Junior.  I've been playing for over fifty years and owned many -- many quite fine, costly, guitars. But as others have discovered, these older, P90-equipped Epis belie their cost. They play and sound GREAT.  With one exception: They come with pretty poor tuners.\", \"I have both Teles and Strats, and they both rite in this case perfectly. The extra storage areas are great, and you don't get outside storage pockets on a hard case.  The case is very well made, durable, and light.  I think the price for this product is a very good value. I know this will suit my needs perfectly!\", \"These are not bad for the price and have a good feel to them weight wise. I would say beginner sticks for sure but once you get to be a better drummer and you are learning how to make different sounds with your kit like a rim shot. These will snap off fast. It didn't take too long for my son to snap the tip off doing a rim/head hit. if these are for a electric kit, I would give these a 5 star for that perpose\", 'These are too thin to be effective on their own.  I love these for their color and overall aesthetics.', 'This is great. I bought for another reason but used it instead on my hihat and removed the legs which it is meant to do. Its more solid than with legs and less clutter. Now I have to buy another for the original purpose. I love it.', 'I\\'ve been using this little amp for over a month now and totally love it.  I run it into a small cabinet with a Jensen Vintage C8R4 8-inch ceramic speaker housed in a maple 12\" x 12\" cabinet and it sounds amazing.  If you closed your eyes you would think you were hearing a Fender Tweed combo from the 50\\'s.  I use a delay/reverb combo pedal in the effects loop insert and it\\'s as sweet as the larger setups I have in my main music room.  I use this in my office and it\\'s perfect for the space.  I can\\'t believe such vintage tones can come out of a chip-amp that is as small as a stomp pedal.  If you\\'re looking for extremely high gain, try one of the other Hotone amps like the Legacy British Invasion or Purple Wind.', \"Monster grips are a necessity for guitarists and bassists who demand that their pick has a grippy surface! They adhesive on them is very strong and will stick to picksp made of any material. I use them on carbon fiber picks, bone picks, brass pics & horn picks.  I've discovered that they are also handy for other things as well such as pictures and frames on my wall. One monster grip on the back corners of the picture frame will keep them from sliding crooked on the wall!\", \"It works!

The mic isn\\'t the best I have ever seen but for the price range it sure is good. I was skeptical but the XLR did come in handy. And it is heaps better than any built in microphone for any other webcam, laptop etc. The headphones are excellent, far better than any other headphones you\\'ll get for fifty bucks.', \"Judging from the reviews, the quality must be variable, but this one was a quick bolt-on. The neck was straight and even had the correct relief; frets were smooth and will require only minimum hand rolling of the ends. This one had the correct strat heel shape.  It is a beautiful fretboard with lots of character; the inexpensive nut was the right height and easy enough to replace.  I was able to brand it with my logo, give it a few coats of tung oil and put it on a handmade custom ordered offset guitar that I just finished in my workshop. I've ordered another.\", 'Nice heavy duty drawer.', 'Love it. Thick plastic. Good quality ez install.', \"Better than or equal to the higher priced competition. I've used the competition product and prefer this one. Plus the remote comes free, can't beat that.\", 'I was invited to play quasi-Dixieland banjo for a quasi-Dixieland musical (\"The Boy Friend\").  They told me my banjo wasn\\'t loud enough though I thought it was plenty loud. I didn\\'t want to mess with a mike since the sound guys never get that right.  Or with running a DI into the sound board for the same reason.  So I ordered this pickup from Amazon and installed it.  I ran it through a small Crate combo amp (XT65R); it was plenty loud - in fact I\\'ll be cutting it back tonight.  Sound was OK, would probably be better through an \"acoustic amp,\" but it\\'s good enough for the musical.', \"Looking at these on a guitar when they don't have a single wrap on the post, I found it hard to believe the strings would even stay on but I have now installed two sets of these on two different guitars. One black set and the other is gold. The first guitar would not stay in tune so I tried these. They have been on for nearly a year now and they totally fixed my tuning problem. The second set I put on my brand new Gibson Les Paul only because the first ones worked so well. Super easy fast string changes with the auto trim feature, and no tuning issues at all. At 18:1 gear ratio they dial in a perfect tune and hold it. I prefer these over Grover or any other higher priced tuners available.\", 'Superb built quality and sound. Seriously you pay for the Moog name but damn is it built solid.', \"I was hoping that these weren't cheap quality-wise, and they're not. They are perfect. Fits awesomely on my Shure SM58 and Peavey PV mics.\", \"Upgrading from a Numark Mixtrack Pro to this is night and day.  While I didn't buy it off amazon, I've attached my picture of the set up.

It doesn't look like it's on all the way, but this thing hasn't moved in almost a year!! I would highly recommend this product!!\", 'Truthfully, I had no idea that the even were ukulele capos. But why not? I use them on guitars and banjo, and there are certainly times when you might want to shift key without transposing so you can take advantage of open strings.', \"Cheap and effective. You'll need to print your own decals, but it's MUCH less expensive than the 70 bucks some other fool was trying to get out of us. They look great! Fits my Shure mics nice and snug. Will need to play with the SM57 a bit - not much room left to grab the mic with a foam screen. But we'll work through that.\", 'This happened (check out my picture) in about 3 to 6 months of use.

The images show a all black pop filter but I received a white and pink/purple filter. That's the only reason I'm going to give it 3 starts.

In doing this you need to utilize the piece that comes with your PR40 and secure your mic by screwing it to the bottom of your mic after putting it into the shock mount.

It came exceptionally well packaged an absolutely no flaws. Unlike the cover that came with the guitar, this one is non magnetic, which is a good thing. The GFS guitar is mostly vintage specs and this cover fit perfectly. Makes me wonder if some of the other reviewers got knock offs. I always buy original manufacturer stuff when doing a hardware upgrade, especially if it\\'s only a few bucks more. I\\'ve had my fill of trying to fit crappy, cheap, import stuff.

Had a couple of small dings (see photo of one under strings near bridge) but the important stuff is OK ( neck is straight and the bridge is sound). Fret edges are very smooth. Sounds great but not as good as the Ovangkol.', \"Okay, the idea is good, but the materials used are inferior. What good is a locking mechanism if the cheap plastic breaks off? The plastic part that the nylon strap is looped through broke clean off, right on stage. Luckily it was right at the end of a song as I played the last chord, and I held onto the guitar so it didn't go crashing down on the stage. But it could have, I was just lucky. Where the strap loops onto the plastic mechanism is the weak link. The locking part is a good idea. Not going to trust this thing with my instruments though. I had an old Ernie Ball spare strap in my case with simple leather ends. I will use it from now on.\", \"This guitar is far more beautiful in person. The red to gold tones blend so wonderfully and it has a barely visible tiger-stripe/wood pattern effect that I hadn't noticed prior to purchasing it.

The main reason I bought this was to store my noisy external hard drive.  I can't do that now, so I guess this drawer is just going to hold random crap that I have on my desk.

On several pedals the true bypass switch is loose and on another  pedal the same switch is slightly stiff. Due to the small size of these pedal, I was able to put 11 pedals total on a 12in12in plant caddy after removing the wheels.', 'Thank you', 'These pedals are great!! A friend of mine said I should buy other pedals because these pedals aren\\'t manufactured by a very known brand name but I went with my own judgement and I was not disappointed with them. I have increased my speed a lot since I\\'ve gotten em and I can pedal songs like \"All Nightmare Long\" and \"Beast and the Harlot\" now  =]  great pedals. BUT, it takes time to develop speed so don\\'t think the pedals suck just because you barely get em and you can\\'t go all Jason Costa on em', \"The X1 MkII is an essential part of my setup (Decks, Effects, Browsing etc.) You can midi map it to other DJ software (This is an update to a previous 2 star review) I know now how to use most of it's features.\", \"I like these microphpone windscreens and the price can't be beat. I have a few lavalier microphones and wanted to use them for recording outdoors. Unfortunately they are larger than what I would consider a lav mic windscreen. I have found they work best with my olympus me51s lav mic and they significantly reduced wind/ambient noise outside. The colors are nice and help in location them and not misplacing them. I have lost so many small black lav wind screens that if I had a dime...well you know the rest. I included a picture in the customer gallery so you can see beyond the stock photo what you're buying. I would recommend and just mention again, be aware of the size you're getting.\", 'The last drummer who played the USA Ludwig kit I my studio used a set of the black paint Vic Firth Steve Gadd signature stick and left black paint marks all over my white coated drum heads as black paint flecks all over. Luckily I already knew that a tiny bit Magic Eraser removes things like that from those drum heads.', \"These stands are balanced, sturdy and lightweight. The locking strap is a nice feature but not even necessary. Not sure how some people are placing their guitars, but unless they have a defecting unit, it's pretty impossible to mess up.

Over all great even tone. Not to bright but clear.', \"I've used this on a dozen flights and it's nice and hard, great for protecting my bow.\", 'I have been using these DR flatwound bass strings with a great deal of amazement.  I have installed these strings on two of my basses and I find them to be most excellent for my needs.  For one thing, these kind of strings are not \"fret eaters\" due to their flatwound smooth surface.  Also, they are lots easier on your fingers if you should play that way.  The various tones and behaviors that these strings produce is hard to describe, but it is a situation that very much agrees with me.  You almost have to hear them to really know.  I just got done installing a set of these DR\\'s on a Reverend Thundergun 4 string bass and they sound awesome.  It might be noted that this bass has a 34\" scale neck and string through bridge.  I had no problems with installation or in tuning.  I am pretty much committed to these style of bass strings.  However a word of caution here.  These strings are not supposed to fit long scaled necks.  I shall conclude this review with 6 pictures.  5 stars on these strings for dang sure :)', \"This strap is well made and is very comfortable. I installed Dunlop Straploks, which was a chore because the leather is so thick, but I got them on without cutting or modifying the strap. The leather is soft and the padding is nice. I bought another brand of leather strap that claimed it was padded but it wasn't. This strap is nice and cushiony. Highly recommended!\", \"It's great for my Taylor 150e 12-string guitar.... My only issue is that the wand it came with had a tear in the microfiber duster.\", \"Works so good that I didn't expect it to. The connected is not locked into any one position which means it's always turning so that can be a bit annoying. But once set, this small device delivers better than my amp. Was thinking of getting for a friend. I may just do so since it is this good\", \"My use for a guitar stand is primarily so my guitar actually gets played instead of sitting in it's case.  I love this stand!  It is stable and the pitch on it isn't so great for my Martin DC-15E that it takes up a lot of space.  I like that it doesn't have the higher piece that sits on the neck so it doubles as a decorative piece.  I couldn't be happier!\", \"So far I really love this tuner. Nice, large Brite screen, it's fully chromatic and your able to change the Hz for non standard tunings, like A 432, which I have actually tune songs recorded in. One issue, don't forget to turn it off as apparently if you don't, it will not shut down on its own due to inactivity and will drain the battery to zero.\", 'LOVE LOVE LOVE this controller. I use it with the free Serato software for professional gigs. Only downside is the microphone input which does not have much control. It was hard to get the right balance without feedback. I easily fixed this by using my amp input and external mixing board to control the mic levels.', 'I have been using Fender locking tuners for about five years on various strats and teles.

The Xvive Sweet Leo O2 Distortion pedal is a great budget lead lead pedal. Im super impressed with the build quality and packaging from Xvive as well as the tones. If you are looking for a good lead distortion pedal that functions like how a tube amp works, you may want to consider this pedal. In this video I test it out on my Stratocaster (Partscaster) with humbucker pickups.', \"It's hard to give less than 5 stars because this light is just an amazing value. It packs a serious punch in terms of output and feels quite sturdy. It has a very thin profile and the housing is a thick rugged plastic. Mounting hardware feels smooth and easy to adjust. The display on the back is larger than other lights of this style which is nice when configuring DMX channels. I control mine via a software DMX system, so I can't speak for the built-in modes. It has worked flawlessly in a DMX environment.\", \"I got these because I hate changing strings on a floating tremolo any more than I absolutely have to.... at first I thought I may have made a mistake because the tone was all off (super bright sounding on first installation).... played for a half hour and retuned, sounded better. Played for another half hour and retuned, sounded even better. Played for another few hours and they sound fantastic. Will update after I get a hundred hours on them (about 50 days from now). Will say that they handle bends very well and dive bombing deep on the trem hasn't hurt them yet.... VERY IMPRESSED\", \"The first one of these I used, did not work at all. After troubleshooting, I solder out the tone control and switched it for the volume pot that seemed to be shorted out perhaps from too much heat from the ground soldering on the back from the factory. Everything worked but there was still hum that I eliminated by running it through an effects pedal. The second one worked but had overwhelming static and hum, but it was cheap. I wired bypassing the controls, plugged it into a separate volume pedal and into an amp. It works fine now but with a little hum. I may still use these in the future because they are very inexpensive. I would use a better and more expensive pickups on better quality guitars. In the future, for one of my inexpensive projects, I would probably just order the pickup without the wiring harness and controls. But, rethinking, even buying an output jack and a bit of shielded cable at Radio Shack would have been more expensive in the end. You can't beat the price.\", 'Great idea, but unfortunately the clamp doesnt work correctly. You can only adjust it with the tab in the closed position, as opposed to the position shown in the instructions, defeating the easy on/off feature. Also the bracket that attaches the clamp to the cup holder uses a single screw, which loosened up while I was trying to attach the clamp to a mic stand. I was able to tighten it up, but I needed to remove the bracket in order to do so. Further, even after tightening this screw, the bracket still had a tendency to swivel.', \"They're pretty perfect for my violins, but I have to readjust them often\", 'This is a great little gadget. Being a lead Guitarist I,m always look for a new sound. This little reverb works great working with all My other pedals. I highly recommend this one to all My other Guitarist friends out there. ~Pepper~ Austin Texas', \"Works well! And the free guitar picks don't hurt. Looks nicer than a standard silver/black capo, and functions just as well.

Please note this is not a bridge you can unpack and simply insert you must fit the feet to your violins top. Really enjoy the curve of the strings as well. All in all a great step up from the factory fit bridge that came on my instrument.', \"I'd give it 5-stars if it was filled-in around the connector (cleaner look and easier to hit in the dark).  Otherwise it was a great solution to cleanly put  an access port on the front of my portable recording rig.  I have lots of USB-A to USB-B cables about, so that connected me to a standard USB audio interface inside the rack also with a B connector.  I already had another B-to-A adapter like this for a USB charging jack that is reversed, with the A-B cable on the inside going to a standard USB charger.\", 'My husband got Guitar Hero for Christmas and on a whim added one of these hangers to his wish list.  One of our friends got it for us, almost as a joke-- but then we mounted it and realized how handy it was!  It works wonderfully for our little plastic guitar, saves it from getting scratched up in the closet, and looks pretty darn cool.  Highly recommended!', 'For the price, these claves sound amazing.  I wanted a natural wood tone as an alternative to the piercing, higher pitch of my fiberglass LP King claves.  These did the trick.  Amazing value.', \"Great replacement. 3 ply and made very well. As good as the Fender parts. NOTE: This is for the made in Mexico (MIM) or Fender American Standard Stratocaster. Please read all the specs on the website description. See a lot of people complaining it doesn't fit their Strat. Well it's because it wasn't made for their model. This will NOT fit a Squier or Roadhouse, Deluxe. Do your homework and you won't land up with the wrong pickguard.\", \"Agreed not for the Bonham wanna-B's.\", 'purchased a very used studio les paul...ruff shape buddies came together and super cleaned it..changed the knobs..glad i did these did the job just fine..will use again', 'look great on my les paul', \"a little higher up than I thought it would be, but nice that I got my pedal board running a little under my amp, now i don't kick my amp when i go to switch effects.  Wish there was more adjustability but it is what it is, one of the more affordable stands can't be asking too much.  The back power plug socket on my amp (Bugera v5) barely interferes with the back bar of the stand (bottom of the plug hitting top of the bar) but I got the weight of the amp slightly resting on it and I don't think it's severe enough that it's a danger.  Stand won't be moved around much so  I expect it to last for a long long time.\", 'This is a great option for creating a lively, party-like atmosphere. It lights up with many different colors and can be used for many different environments. Its very portable and I like that there is very little set-up involved.', 'These strings are wonderful. My go to strings have been the Gibson Bill Monroe, however amazon does not stock those currently. So I decided to give these a try because they are the same gauge and phosphorus bronze just like the Gibson. These sound just as good if not better than the Gibson BM strings. They are warm, bright and very projecting. They have that signature bluegrass sound that you hear on the classics. I love these strings!', \"I like this pedal cause it's similar to Mesa sound...Love JOYO\", 'Best strap lock system out there! -', 'For the price of tunable bongos you get 3 roto-toms and a stand.  An inexpensive way to expand your current drum set.', \"I think that this is a great product (because it is for a complete keyboard), but I do have one tiny, tiny problem... They are so tiny that I can't see them.  I looked at many vendors for this type of product and because yours ran the full gambit, I chose it.  If you have any that are larger and has all 88 keys, I'll trade with you!\", \"I bought this to fit into an Ibanez Edge Tremolo. It was a little different to figure out, but once you get it fine tuned and set up right it worked absolutely perfectly. My trem was blocked so I didn't have to worry about it interfering with the recessed route.\", \"this uke sounds so good! it is my favorite out of all my other expensive ones! i can't believe i got it for 40.00$!!\", \"Took a little while to arrive, but it's good quality!...put this on a subRay 4 bass pick guard fits but the hole don't line up 100%, but that doesn't bother me\", \"If you want some fun or you are having a down day (and who doesn't some times)...just get this! It is so much fun. Turn on your favorite music and turn this on by simply plugging it on a wall outlet and watch the light show - just fantastic, if you like bright colorful lights. The colors vary and change depending on the sounds from your own music. These are LEDs so very little electricity is used. You can place this table top or hang it on a wall.\", \"I was pleasantly surprised with this Hankey ukulele. It looks beautiful the neck is great the sound is great acoustic and electrically with amp or pa. Well worth the money worth the money. I'm very happy with my investment. I highly recommend this awesome Ukulele. ;)\", \"My ES*335 fit loose and needed some padding added to keep the guitar snug, but if you don't mind doing that it's a good deal...\", \"Just what I needed, although at it's lowest setting, wass about an inch too tall for me sitting on the edge of my bed. Ive gotten used to it now so it's all good! Like others have said, it's good quality and sturdy construction. I stubbed my toe on it in The night, and quickly wished that hadn't happened! The rubber grip on top is actually riveted on, so that should last a good while. I also used this for when I practice standing up. I rest my foot on it which pushes the bottom of my guitars out so I can see what I'm doing. All in all its a good product and I recommend it. A word of warning, this is made of strong metal, if you're buying this for your son or daughter, show them the dangers of the scissoring action of the legs. I imagine they could do some hurtin to little fingers.\", 'This pedalboard is the best value entry level board ive seen on amazon.... Very well made, sits on floor with a good angle, very useful slats and spacing to make cables tidy underneath so you can organise the pedals in a non linear fashion  .  Its big enough to grow into. Love the lightweight aluminum. Velcro straps come with it to strap on your mini power supply (donner psu no less lol).  I also hid my noise suppressor underneath since thats an always-on pedal.  This way, you get even more pedal space on top. I fit all my pedals and probably room for one or two mini pedals or one more regular sized pedal.', 'Adding some twang to my Jim Dandy campfire guitar.', \"The flute came in good shape, but there are two holes in the under side bottom, toward the end, with both holes connecting to one another at a 45 degree angle.  There's no way to cover these holes and play the flute.  I'm guessing it's a manufacturing mistake, where someone got a little too happy with the hole drilling!!\", \"It's bigger than I expected and when you pull it out of the box it comes in it has this square shape. LOL. I like it and will hold on to the box just for that. Fits perfectly easy on off. The black area is rubber. I thought it would be foam. Pretty good at wind protection. No popping. It looks good with the H4N Pro. A few loose hairs and sheds a little bit but hopefully all the loose ones with be gone after a little while.\", 'I would give this 2.5 stars. The reason they disappointed me somewhat is that the squares have a degree of variability to them. See my picture. Some are taller than others, some are more grey others more black. And even after sitting a few days there were still dents in them. They worked but after buying 96 of these I wanted more uniformity.', 'This added the je ne sais quoi to my PA sound.', \"Fantastic case I got for a great price.  Thank you Amazon for saving me $70 on this one item as compared to Musician's Friend or Sweetwater.  I had several guitars I could use this with but it fit the one I was hoping it would a Schecter OMEN-8.\", 'Quite possibly the nicest guitar straps on the market.', \"I installed these myself using the Elenco Electronics ST-12 Soldering Tool Kit on a 2012 Fender American Stratocaster. I didn't like the Custom Shop Fat 50's that were installed. I wanted something that could growl, that was noiseless but still kept the chime of the king tone and these pickups deliver. I adjusted them a couple of times (not too high) and may have found the sweet spot. I don't change pickups too often but the fat 50's sounded too farty and muffled to my ears. I also like to play a wide range of styles ranging from Jeff Beck jazz to Yngwie Neoclassical to John Mayer blues. These pickups are able to handle those styles easily. Most importantly they are dead silent and that's important when you're doing a lot of recording.\", 'With a much needed modification, this became a far more durable board.', \"Guys, this is a really good sounding pedal.  It has enough highs-lows-mids to make you smile.  The sound is similar to pedals costing much more.  Of course, everything is based on taste and the kind of music you play.  This is not a super scooped metal pedal.  It's best for strong overdrives and smooth grudge sounds.  The big factor about this pedal compared to more expensive pedals is that it doesn't like HEAT.  I had a gig in Detroit on a metal stage with a 100 degree PLUS day.  The pedal didn't like it at all.  My BOSS Blues driver was just fine.  Of course the Blues Driver is a $100 pedal. It took the temps just fine. So, that is, in my opinion, the big difference between what you get with JOYO vs other, more expensive, pedals.  Keep in mind, if you are not playing in 100 degree temperatures you have nothing to fear. So, rock on and enjoy your music!!\", 'Just upgraded to this board and I am very happy I did. I needed more stereo inputs and this one had 4 of them. When it comes to an internet radio station you need a clean quiet board. I have no noise coming out of this board so I am very pleased. Plus I needed the AUX outs for my TelosONE set up. Everything is working perfect!', 'I do wish some reviewers would do a little basic research into what they are buying before posting negative comments. This neck plate is a high quality replacement for the plate that comes standard on newly-manufactured US Strats (and probably Teles). I purchased this to update the look of my \\'97 \"weird, fat logo\" neck plate and am very pleased with the results. The material appears to be aluminum or aluminum alloy with a chrome finish, in contrast to the heavier steel that it replaced. I did not bust out the calipers but it is at least as thick as the older version. It is not plastic, nor pot metal. It comes with screws. For giggles, I stopped by Guitar Center after installing it and yep...all American Standard Strats have this exact same neck plate.', 'This strap is advertised for a mandolin, but I put it on my ukulele. I found guitar straps (usually 2 inches wide) and even dedicated ukulele straps (usually 1.5 inches wide) to be too bulky and uncomfortable. This strap is only 3/8\" inch wide, but my ukulele is so lightweight that I really don\\'t need anything wider and a narrower strap doesn\\'t get in the way of my arms and hands. Installing this strap without removing my ukulele strings took some effort. I had to unthread the strap loop (which is really much tighter than it needs to be), then thread the strap end under my ukulele strings, then thread it back through the strap loop (which is still much tighter than it needs to be). The plastic buckle in the middle of the strap is not removable, so you need to thread that through strap loop and it is a real tight fit. Once installed, the strap works great. The thin soft-ish cotton is more comfortable on my shoulder than thick leather or stiff nylon strap and it doesn\\'t seem to scratch my ukulele wood at all.', \"If you're looking for an inexpensive party light, this is a great option.  The beams are pretty tight and is really set off with a fog machine.  The speaker inside was shocking at first (when you plug it in there is a commanding voice talking about bluetooth connectivity.)  There is a little wireless remote that is useful within 10 feet or so.  The motor is a bit loud but with music playing you won't notice.\", \"I Purchased this unit primarily for sweetening up a violin pickup and an acoustic guitar with an LR Baggs pickup. I'm highly impressed with the improvement in the acoustic guitars tone and character. The parametric equalizer is fantastic for dialing in perfect tone. The unit is dead quiet, the only noise noted was when I tightened up the bandwidth and boosted level into the upper 3rd of its range on the parametric eq. In microphone applications the unit performs equally well and the low cut worked great for reduction of handling noise. This is a fantastic tool at a bargain price. I own an ART tube MP preamp also and this unit is definitely a solid step up from the MP. Thanks to Behringer for making great quality affordable products for musicians on a budget. The only knock I can come up with at this point is that the manual is extremely basic and if you're a new user of mic pre's you're kind of on your own. It would be nice if they had included some application recommendations for basic settings,\", 'I previously purchased the 20\\' cable for my SG and Marshall amp, and I was very satisfied. I have a couple of pedals with different variations that I wanted to incorporate, and the old saying \"If it ain\\'t broke, don\\'t fix it\" came to mind. So I ordered 2 of the 6\\' cables to complete my personal set up. You can\\'t go wrong with these. Great Cords!', \"Love this stuff so far. Looks awesome and I can definitely hear the difference acoustically. Hoping I don't run into the blue / green issue that other reviewers have seen.\", \"Love the beefy strings.  Depending on the style of music you play, you might want to give the heavier strings a spin around the block.  If you're on full-tilt distortion all the time, you probably won't see a difference, but if you play without a lot of pedals and like that slightly crunchy breakup to come from your amp, the Beefy strings can make a big difference.\", \"Another update. How can you sell these to people! I have a craft show this weekend and i went to put these tumers on and none id the screws fit! First one i didn't realize and it got stuck. I had to use two pliers to pull it off and scratched mlthe new neck i just finished making. Your company shpuld not be selling these! I now hqve to run out and find somewhere to but 6 sets ....Update....i ordered more, they came in odd. The top is too wide that the nuts don't fit!\", 'As I said elsewhere, the pick wears on the edges, and breaks very quickly, within hours if you play hard. I use it on an acoustic guitar with Medium to Light strings, so really! After at least 3 years, I am still using my Dunlop medium guitar pick. The rubber part also \"hangs\" on the low E string, especially if you are trying to hit it for the first beat of the measure or simply for emphasis. This is probably a bad habit, which I could unlearn, but only if the pick would last longer!', \"Works great as a guitar bench mat. Not rugged enough for abuse but if you take care of it, it will take care of you. Makes organization of workspace much easier because screws won't roll around. Color is good too.\", 'I ordered these for my Road Worn Player Tele,  They fit perfectly. no more winding strings and my tuning problems have been resolved!!!!!!!!!!', 'Everything met my expectations the product was good quality, easy to install even without directions included and my guitars look great hanging on the wall. I read negative reviews saying that the quality was crap and it took them an hr to get it threaded onto the base. Unless you have no basic knowledge of being handy this will not be a problem just make sure you find a stud on the wall and screw the included screws through the drywall and securely into the stud. Before you do this  run the  screw that attaches to the base through the threads to avoid any issues like the negative reviewer had. After you attach the base to the wall thread in the guitar hanger screw firmly and you are good to go. I personally would easily buy one of these for the price of 2 they are great quality for the price and if you have more than one guitar to hang then this product is a must buy!!!!', 'I purchased two of these to hang guitars in my music room. These are well made and certainly do the job okay. However, I completely did NOT trust the two skimpy screws they provided to hang this unit. They are basically drywall screws, but these have a rather skinny diameter. I was not about to trust my vintage P-Bass to a skinny screw inside a hollow-wall fastener. No, I used a heavier \"construction screw\" directly into a wall stud. See photo. I was seriously concerned that the supplied skinny screw would actually break off in the stud. If you are hanging a lightweight acoustic, then the supplied hardware should be fine. I\\'m probably just being paranoid and overly cautious.  Other than that, I like it (tho walnut piece could be a little bigger in my opinion).', \"Great, lightweight product that easily replaces some of my older lighting that's nearly eight times the size and weight.  Having two synced with a DMX cable easily fills the room.  The extra colors not available in many of the big name lights is great addition (orange, purple and white).  Only time will tell how reliable they are.  I'm not a big fan of the white house (which glows), but aside from that, they're perfect.\", \"Bag itself seems to be nice enough, certainly the stand fits. The strap failed me and broke upon first use, not even with heavy weight in it. The carabiner slipped out of the socket thing. I don't know how to explain it, all I know is I had to replace the strap altogether.\", \"I bought this bcos it was cheap. The fastener is difficult to unclip due to its tiny size. I have small hands. I like it better if the strings are shorter, so it won't dangle. So far it serves me well\", 'This is nominally a violin/viola stand, but due to the length and neck diameter, also works well as a mandolin stand. My Paris Swing mandolin fits nicely into the Auto Grip holder. An added bonus is that my Irish bodhran (18\" frame drum) rests comfortably on top of the Auto Grip assembly, with the bottom of the rim resting against the padded legs as does the body of a stringed instrument.', 'This thing kicks some serious butt.

I just ordered from here. After putting in a 9V battery and plugged in my Gretsch guitar, instantly I heard the punching sound of rockabilly. Never did I ever heard any strange sounds of feedback or popping or screeching. It was quiet and perfect for me even when I played it real close to the amp. I did not purchase the DC adaptor, just relying on batteries. Imagine I could play electric guitar in my car, how portable is this thing! The bad thing about this is that the box packaging looks cheap and printing was bad. The brand name of the amp is located at its back, kind of shy of telling others it's Fender. At first I suspected it was fake. However the sound doesn't lie. I realized this amp cost more than the others, not sure if other brands are equally good as well.\", 'This happened (check out my picture) in about 3 to 6 months of use. I guess you by cheap, you get cheap results.', 'No the best sound but for practice along without disturbing the neiborhoods is the cheap and best option...', \"I LOVE this thing. It works as a VOLUME pedal, WAH pedal and EXPRESSION pedal, all in one. Also, the WAH sounds amazing. The small size of the top plate makes it a breeze to use and pull off all kinds of things that are much more difficult with a full size wah.  In short, it's built like a tank, sounds amazing and looks great :)\", \"Don't care what anyone says, these things are great. I've completely upgraded my lighting with just two of these. Nice and bright, easy to setup master and slave and very durable if treated with care and properly stored/transported.\", 'This would be my fourth Ocarina Wind ocarina. It is by far my FAVORITE. I love the \"Sound of Earth\" design. The mouthpiece is perfectly sized. The body design is very comfortable and feels natural to hold. The rough finish makes it feel sturdy and adds some nice grip! The slight indent at the subholes makes it very easy and comfortable to use them. (My trumpet creeper ocarina\\'s subholes are a pain, and the \"rythym of the earth\" are a little close, I am always hitting them on accident!) It is also the most in tune, all notes! It has a great, mellow but resonating sound. I would love to see more aesthetics with this body design! I truly was surprised. I have 3 other ocarinas from them that are more than reasonably priced for decent product, but this one in particular blew my expectations out of the water! I definitely recommend this for any level, especially beginner at this price. It is worth much more than what it is being sold for! I actually bought another!', 'All I have to do is install this on my Strat. Instructions gave me a good idea of what needs to be done, and I have experience with all kinds of stuff since I was involved with all types of Proto-Typing in many different machine shops so it should be a fun project.', \"I play guitar with a flat pick. But I also play ukulele, and hard picks can make the uke sound a little harsh. I've tried felt uke picks, but they never felt comfortable. So I use one of these Alaska Pik Fingerpicks over my index finger for strumming. Size is important. I have medium sized hands, and these picks can slip off my fingertip when it's hot and muggy, like when I'm playing at an outdoor market. That can cause some awkwardness when trying to strum, sing and keep the pick from flying off my finger. I might try the next size smaller in the future. But this is the best pick I've found for getting a loud, round sound out of my uke.\", \"I absolutely love these!! I bought these colorful wind screens for my karaoke microphones.

I received the right colors!\", \"I have always hated tuners; I would rather use tuning fork on the A string and go from there.

I bought this last year for an 96' Korean Squire that I have been slowly but surely replacing everything on as a learning project.  Time marched on and I finally put them in tonight and all I have to say is Wow!  The difference in these and the originals is just off the scale.  I never realized how much amp hiss I was getting until I plugged these in for the first time.  I had to actually hit a string to make sure it was working.  I can not say enough good things about these affordable pickups.  I have another MIM strat with some boutique pickups that are marketed as noiseless but I honestly believe I actually like the tone of these better for a fraction of the cost. If you have an old Strat laying around these are the pickups you need to bring it roaring back to life.  I have attached a pic for those who wonder how the covered pickups look installed.\", \"Bought these for my Peavey Raptor Plus EXP that I'm currently rebuilding. The screw was a bit longer than the one that was for the original string tree, so it took a bit longer and had to use a little bit of elbow grease to fully get it screwed it.

It was cut towards one end and as I unrolled it, a shower of the black mushroom nubs came falling out (see picture). Hmm...maybe just a bad roll. I opened the second one. This one was one continuous piece, and only a few nubs fell out. Ok, lets test it out. I attached it to itself and pressed it together. Nice grip. Then I pulled it apart, and several bunches of nubs came tearing out as well. If I'm going to attach something to my pedal board that will bond permanently, I don't want  something that will tear itself apart and leave bald patches every time I move a pedal. I'm sure it would work fine, if you don't move things around, but just the idea that I can't do it do often doesn't sit well. Oh well, expensive lesson learned. Get the 3M instead.

I was looking for a hard case that had a pair of backpack straps, which this model does. I don't know if all the colors have that, but I was told that the red, white and champagne colored cases have the removable backpack straps. The straps are also nicely padded. Really if there was anything I would find fault with is that it is a rather heavy case, being fiberglass. But that's a price I'm happy to pay for the bombproof security this case affords my expensive Pono ukulele.\", 'This was an eBay buy to flip. Not a bad Bass guitar. Just not worth much, used or new. The bridge pickup is very noisy. The pickups are not an active pickup. If they were an Active pickup without the BOOM sound, then I would say its a 4 star.

Unfortunately, I can't endorse these strings, even though they sound great and the light gauge saves my fingers. The problem is that they break, in my humble opinion, excessively easily. I put a set on and broke a g string within 2 days of moderate use. It snapped near the saddle, so I didn't think much of it. I replaced the set, and within a few more days I noticed that the wrapping on the g string was broken and becoming unraveled near my third fret.

In other words, it isn't as sticky as adhesive.  But, for most situations, it certainly does the trick and can removed in an instant and does not deface the guitar surface in any fashion.

I control it with an IPAD Air 2- prefer it over Android as I can place the RTA, the EQ and the channel strip all on the same screen without having to toggle.

Take note that it was listed on my computer as a headphone device rather than an instrument cable, so don't get confused by how it is listed in the USB devices.

I recently purchased a Pearl Birch Vision kit for my wife which came with Pearl's I.S.S. mounting system.  To be fair I've never used them, and in the case of the new kit they came right off, and the Optimounts went right on.  Even though these are not the aluminum (more expensive and slightly lighter) Masterworks version, I feel they not only work for what they're intended, but they also accent the drum shells without being intrusive.

Apart from these minor details I'm well satisfied with the product.\", \"These wall hangers are superb. I don't understand why others of inferior quality cots twice as much. These are made out of solid wood (looks like Pinewood) glazed over with weather protective urethane. The great thing about this is that it supports all sizes of guitars, from small Ukuleles to full size. That is due to the rubber rings which they include to avoid smaller necks falling out. Another very nice thing is that the arm is screwed into a wood nut, which makes it super secured while allowing for movement in case you have odd neck shapes (like fender strats) which require a little angle.\", \"Purchased the 5-hole pickguard in eggshell for my MIM Baja Telecaster. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much since I hated the cheap, white plastic version that came stock. Black Bakelite looked good, gold anodized aluminum looked better, but somehow this one just seems right. It's a heavy, vintage thickness, rigid, and very high quality.

It also only came with 2 screws instead of the 4 needed. I had the four screws that came with the guitar anyway, from the plastic jack plate I was replacing, so that was no problem either. The screws were a bit bigger than the intended screws so it gave it a bit more of an industrial look that was unintentional but I think it looks good nonetheless.

I just picked up a gorgeous Gibson ES-335 from 2001 with the Classic 57, and man, I like this way better than the burstbucker pro!  Both are great pickups, but these have such great bite in the lead and smooth in neck I can stop listening to it.  Every note rings so nicely.

I read comments saying that the green wire goes with the red and the white is hot. Mine came with the red wire as hot, and I didn't change that. It works, and it definitely sounds like a beige pickup is supposed to, so it think you should just trust whatever setup the factory gives you. Also, I know other people explained this, but many said they had to enlarge the pickup hole to accommodate the pickup. You DO NOT.

I did kind of dent the inside of a gold one as I put it on my squire, so you do have to be careful when installing.

Pop's (when fresh) is the stickiest. Nyman is hard and powdery. Kolstein is very sticky and there is almost no powder at all. There is something special in their formulation. I believe Kolstein includes wax in their rosin recipe, which keeps dust from forming. The other benefit of Kolstein is that it lasts for a very long time on the shelf. Pop's will dry out in less than 2 years. Some people will only use Pop's for a few months before throwing it away. I go back and forth between Kolstein and Pop's. I still can't decide which is my favorite. But them both and try it out.\", \"So far so good. Never heard of Lazarro and who cares? The saxophone can perform. The brand doesn't matter.

Mine came with Lazarro reeds 2 1/2 strength and now I use D'Addario Select Jazz reeds 3S and it does the trick.  If you know how to take care of the saxophone it'll last. Well worth the investment.

I tried some no-drill straps, but ultimately chose to add a strap button with no problem. I saw some reviews about quality control issues on the finish, and I did find a rough spot on the back (see photo). This was not an issue for me, but I'd suggest checking for this.

This produces a naturally smooth sound that you can get with your nails.  I got the medium size. They fit great on all my fingers but I might try the larger version for my thumb but the medium works great if you bend the plastic back and it makes it looser around the thumb.', \"Great product and price. I bought these panels for a home studio, mostly for mixing a tracking as I don't do much live recording there.

Great if you want to do some recording in an area that is not sound treated that you can't get away with using a condenser microphone in.  It has a lot of character as it's frequency response is far from flat.  Attenuation of the lows and a pretty beefy boost in the presence without going too bright.  It's a bit louder that the Shure sm58, but not hugely.  Still needs quite a bit of preamp, about 70% up on my preamp to remain in unity on my mixer for reasonable recording levels.  It's got a good sound to it.  I think it's super short sighted of Behringer to fail to include the frequency profile of this microphone on the Amazon store page, but don't worry I've got you all covered.

I have an old Ibanez RG that I just didn't want to fuss with as far as tuning adjustments. Installed this with an extra spring and really tightened up the claw into the body, works as advertised. The coolest part is how you can set your bridge height before the final claw adjustment. Can still dive if I want but I'm just having fun playing the RG again in alternative tuning. I can go from 1/2 step down Van Halen right back up to standard leads w/o having to access the cavity. I may get a Tremol-no for my American Strat as I feel this is too limiting for a more expensive guitar.\", \"Great nylon strings, just as expected. They worked just fine on my daughter's mini classical guitar. They are as good quality wise as much more expensive strings I've purchased in the past.

It works quite well, especially with a guitar ran through it for key reference. We have used it for many different applications, and different styles, and it seems to work under most conditions. I really enjoy the variation you have at your disposal with this pedals settings. You can have 1 or 2 lines of harmony, and you can chose whether they are each higher or lower, and between a 3rd and a 5th or the root note. The ability to control those factors makes a world of difference. I would recommend checking out some of the demo review videos if you are interested in this pedal.', \"I loved using this while producing videos with my Canon EOS 6D, but it didn't last long.  When I inserted the battery into the receiver, one of the battery contacts broke off.  Here are some pictures of the receiver mounted on my EOS 6D and a picture showing the broken contact wire.  The battery holder has a bad design because the contacts are weak wire loops and the battery fits very snug and puts a lot of pressure on these weak contacts.  Samson should update the battery holder design.

To my surprise this is a wonderful ukulele!  Its light weight construction makes its tone warm, bright and rich.  The construction on the instrument is very high quality.  If your looking for a beautifully designed comfortable playing ukulele, look no more.  Even the etching on the body is very nice.  Luna makes a few other designs in this etched series.  So if you don't like this design there are others to choose from.

They can still be mixed on, and give a good all around frequency response. What you want to be careful of is the bass, and mixing bass on these because they will not provide all of the bass that is really there. They are great for mids. The portability is amazing! Along with the fact that you will NOT need an audio interface with these! The Mic plugs directly into the speaker! What a easy and accessible way for an artist to record his vocals, or for a guitarist to to record his notes. Definitely a good investment!\", \"This box does everything I need it to. It's passive, so it doesn't color the sound, it makes for easy switching between my two sets of monitors, and even has an auxiliary input (RCA connection) with separate volume control (which I use to patch in an xbox. Gotta take 5 from working every once in a while!). The main volume knob is really smooth and has some slight resistance, which makes it feel great when dialing in levels.\", \"Deep tone and I'm a fan!\", \"These speakers sound great! I've had a pair of cube Auratone reference monitors for 30 yrs that still sound great but these iLouds are another level. Strong bass, crystal clear mids and highs. They are computer speakers on steroids! The pairing of inboard amp matched perfectly with the drivers makes sure you are getting great sound. They are Bluetooth capable too which I didn't even notice at first because it isn't stated loudly on the package. They aren't inexpensive but neither are good microphones and guitars. If you can afford the price, you will be pleased.

It fits in your hand and is a decent output of light. It is dmx which we all know is awesome! Dmx makes the world a little easier to control! The colors are red green blue and white. The only thing I do not like is the way the colors are mixed, you can see the outside of the color when you mix them.

I'm using it with an antique German lute guitar (wandervogellaute), and the stained glass pattern complements the carved rosette of the sound hole in a vaguely ecclesiastical motif -- while still looking a little hippie.  The lute guitar is extremely lightweight, so I can't speak to how well the strap would hold up a heavy solid body electric guitar, but it seems to be very sturdily made, and is definitely comfortable.\", 'I really like the simplicity of this bridge. It adjusts easy for string height and length. It comes with all the mounting screws and even a small allen wrench to make the height adjustments. The provided mounting screws are Phillips head screws. The one thing that I missed when I ordered this was the fact that it is not a bridge for string-thru the guitar body placement. The strings dead end to the stop-flair of the plate. I included a picture of this so it may help to make others aware that it is not for string-thru applications. No biggie tho for me, I will use it on another project now.', 'They are nice picks but much smaller than they appear in your photos!', \"Perfect fit on my 2016 Gibson Les Paul Studio Faded.

I was pleasantly surprised to see the one thing I disliked about mine had been changed. The mount that attaches to your desk has received an upgrade, allowing for a tighter fit on the boom arm stalk, and a more robust build of the mount overall. My previous mount had a D-shaped hole the boom arm stalk slipped into, which allowed for a lot of movement regardless of how tight you made the clamping screw. It was also equipped with an oversized plastic wingnut for securing the mount to the desk. The upgraded mount rectifies both those issues.', \"I received this pedal as a gift.  A compressor is a subtle effect, but it has made a great addition to my pedal board.  The construction of the pedal is solid.  It adds character to chords and enhances leads.

Overall, good pedal for the price.\", 'I wanted something light and compact that can hold a few items, but also fit well in a carry-on and protect the jamstik indoors or out.

It timely arrived. The center mike holder opening is for a much larger microphone than the ATR 2100, that I own. The 2100 indicates 51mm, but that is at the mike area, not the trunk which is much smaller and used for mounting to the shock mount. After researching a replacement in the same price range, I found none. I had some foam pipe insulation for 1/2 inch pvc pipe in the utility room. This is readily available from most any big box hardware store.  I cut the foam about 4\" in length and placed the 2100 in the foam. It fits perfect. I didn\\'t seal the foam, but it is just right and tight in the mount holder. I now have a shock mount that can be used if, and when, I purchase a larger microphone. I have attached a photo. After the image was created, I further trimmed the foam length to match the actual size of the mounting holder opening.  This shock mount is a quality product at a great price.', 'This is the worst fitting junk I have ever seen! The pickgaurd is to big and the back plates are to small and the holes do not line up.

Strap itself is really soft, so it doesn't irritate your shoulders and neck while you're playing your guitar. It adjusts pretty easy to your desired length. Buckle is plastic. You may or may not have an issue with that. I personally didn't. It looks amazing, and that's putting it kindly. I've gotten many compliments on it already. Definitely worth the money.

I read one review in which the guy was not satisfied because he said it sounded like \"80\\'s glam rock.\" I totally disagree. If you can play and have a decent amp - you can get a variety of great sounds out of this little box. It seems like so many players like a fuzzy, buzzy type overdrive sound.

I gave it to my guitar player to use and he was very impressed with the improvement in the product, having used other 9 volt practice amps in the past.  Can easily be used to amplify any personal sound needs by using or purchasing a 1/4\" input adapters.  It does not include a power adapter, which would have been a nice addition, so you have to use 9 volt batteries to power your practice sessions.

I bought mine separately) It is one heavy duty mic stand, but I got it for holding up the PYLE PSMRS11 Acoustic Isolation Microphone shield and the damn shield was too heavy to hold in place!  It kept falling over. This mic stand was sold to hold the darn thing but it only works if you place the Isolation Shield in a certain direction (see picture). You must remove the rubber pads that are on the Microphone shield, if you don't you'll find your Isolation shield on the floor! The weight is too heavy for the rubber pads to hold them up (they are glued on). So you have to tighten metal to metal to hold the shield in place. You have to constantly check the tightening supports to make sure they don't pull the support stand down with it! You also have to remove the bottom metal desk supports from the Mic Shield to lighten the load on the Mic Stand. I hope this helps everyone using this for a Mic Shield.\", 'NICE..

Probably not the application intended by the mfg, as they are intended to replicate active metal pickups. The Neck pickup is pretty dark, and lacks volume and clarity. The bridge pickup is louder, and brighter than the neck. I've had both better, and worse pickups... these are just alright. If I had it to do all over again, I probably would have just left the stock pickups in the guitar. It's not worth sending back, as the product does actually work, and tone is such a personal and subjective thing. I'm rating three stars as a neutral rating.\", 'Like these a lot. Easy install.

This might be winning me over. The bass boost is outstanding. The active pickups really allow you to adjust to the sound you want. I recommend this for anyone. If you're a beginner  like I was not too long ago, it's an excellent bass to start with. If you're on tour and/or music is making you money, this bass will be beatiful on stage.

I looked around at the various tie systems available and I bought the Diamond Secure Classical Guitar String Ties because I liked the size. The result was what I needed; B and E1 don't slip with the ties and they stay in tune. I did a double loop with E1 as suggested in the instructions, just to be sure. I was concerned about the appearance of the Ties, but I am satisfied with the look. The Ties are small and have an unobtrusive,  neat appearance.

So, I took it and put it on my Ibanez AS93 (a fairly heavy guitar for being semi-hollow) and they fit, perfectly. I had just done a string change and spent a little over an hour playing and breaking the strings in, this strap is super comfy (especially for not being padded).

This homemade CBG sounds like a legitimate strat. I would definitely use this pickup again in the future, and I have no doubt it would sound good to swap out the pups on a cheapo commercial strat with these. My only complaint, and it's a small one, is that the knobs included had a tiny bit of smearing on the gold paint. It's not a big deal because many pups don't include knobs at all, and there are so many knob options available at very affordable prices.

Also, if you have smaller headstocks on your guitars or basses, you'll probably need to adjust the width of the holder with channel-locks or something similar that can squeeze the sides together.

I have plugged a variety of pedals into the JP-02 and all powered-up as expected.  The AC plug that goes into the wall or power strip is not designed for standard outlets found in the United States.  While this is not an inherent flaw, it is not stated clearly enough in the item description and I do not believe it can be seen in the photos.  JOYO does include a 2-prong adapter for use in the United States.  The adapter is much smaller than the power supply itself, which leaves the bottom of the power supply resting 1-5/8\" away from the outlet (see attached photo).  There simply doesn\\'t seem to be enough surface contact between the base of the power supply and the outlet.  A few trips over the power cord could easily compromise the integrity of the adapter, AC plug and/or your outlet.

It's very easy to use.\", \"Cool little box, I'm using it with my Arturia Microbrute analog synth, looks cool, sound good, easy to use, fits well in gig bag.\", 'Installed these humbuckers on my Epiphone Les Paul Standard. The sound of the neck and bridge humbuckers are very similar. The bridge just has a tad bit more treble. However, both of these HBs produce a very, very warm sound. When playing with an MXR Distortion + it produces a grunge/fuzz sound but keeps clarity of each note. The clarity is outstanding on the HBs-each note can be heard. The HBs are not very versatile, only producing a grunge/fuzz sound, regardless of what distortion pedal I use but it fits my playing style at the moment so I am very happy with them.', \"If you're looking for a gig bag for a semi-hollow guitar or bass, this will do the job. Make sure you are looking for part number 0991622206 - that's the Metro Gig Bag for Semi Hollow basses.\", \"This case is awesome!  The molded interior fits my Fender Jazz Bass like a glove and I feel it's secured at all times.  This is the second case I've owned and the quality is superb!  It balances much better in my hand while carrying it than my last case which was a bit front heavy.  It's also lighter in weight than my previous case too.  The open compartment is deep enough to fit my cable, strap, tuner, accessories and I usually throw my amp power cable in there too.  I also like that the open compartment does not have a door that you always have to open or close.  Just open the case and everything is there for easy access.  Lastly, cosmetically this case is very sweet looking.  The black, white and chrome details are perfect and of course the chrome Fender logo on the top of the case really sets it off.\", 'These sticker pentagrams are real nice. Have some left over and put them on my violin. Badass.', 'I installed this kit in my Squier by Fender Vintage Modified Stratocaster. What a great upgrade. The guitar comes with all those tiny pots and cheap electronics. Get yourself one of these kits if your guitar came with cheap electronics. It is a Tone Buster... :) PS I added a few other mods myself.', \"I wanted gold jacks, not silver. I've built a Steeler-themed guitar (see photo) and these silver jacks are wrong. Will you exchange it for the gold jacks?\", 'Works as advertised (I\\'m sure along with the other 5 or 6 brands out there that are the exact same one- see pic it\\'s the one they shipped). Only thing I\\'d say is pay attention to your current- everything worked fine except my wireless (line 6). It\\'d power up but then go dark. Turns out it was plugged into a 100ma port. It needs upwards of 300+ma. Plugged into the correct port and it was fine. So far no issues after about 6 or 7 gigs. I\\'m surprised because it\\'s priced so cheap. Comes with all the barrel (power) cords (Not the 1/4\" cords). Can\\'t go wrong for under $40.', \"I have a 1986 Peavey Patriot made in the usa guitar. It had one cheap string tree that wasn't a roller. These work great! Make sure to drill the holes for any of these trees you are going to install. The included screw cannot handle the pressure of screwing it in. I will add pictures soon. You won't be disappointed. They add incredible sustain to my guitar!\", \"First of all, I am a HUGE Fender fan. Guitars, amps and especially their pickups.  Second, when it comes to tone, I am very picky. I love the Fender Custom Shop 69s, 54s, 57/62s and Fat 50s. I wanted to try something other than Fender this time, so I chose these SSL-1s. So far I think they are absolutely the best single coil pickup I have ever had. Big, full tone with bell-like highs and a clear bottom end.  On a lot of pickups in Strats the neck pickup can sound too quacky, too much twang and it over powers everything else.  These strike a very nice balance with quack and all the other harmonics that are present.  Some other vintage single coils Ive tried have too much chimey-ness in the tone, too much high, drowns out the mids, again these SSL-1s don't do that, even though there is still tons of chimey, bell-like tones, like glass breaking, very brilliant, but its balanced out with the mid and low tones as well.  Very nice and yes I would buy them again.\", \"At the Price point and what it deliveres it's a must buy. I play Bass. Only a few things I can gripe about and it's the clarity of the notes not being as clear and the split with the music (aux) and headphones..gotta find the right spot. That said it's built great for plastc...very sturdy..and the fact I can USE AAA batteries and not LITHIUM BUILT IN is what sold me over others too! (Buy your own batteries)  Comes with cheap batteries. The device works so well I can change two batteries but if the built in stop working and it fades away.. device is no good. Nobody knows I'm evening practicing or jamming. Very nice should have baught along time ago. I use Beats headphones and Uiisii Us90 ear buds sold on Amazon..the best earbuds you will find!($10!) Find them!  Why the Beats? I use the cord for aux to phone. But u can get an aux cord ..(preference)\", \"Fits my Squier Stratocaster (Bullet) great, with a few inches to spare lengthwise.  Theres a ton of great zipper pockets, the handles are great and the padding is pretty decent. I use this for light traveling for my cheaper guitars. In my opinion I would not put an expensive guitar in here as the padding isn't the best, but it will still resist scratches and small bangs but more than likely not drops.\", \"5 stars. For its price and size, couldn't have asked for more.\", \"Love it! I have had other tuners & recently bought a pedal tuner. I like this because it's much more convenient. The pedal wears through 9 volt batteries pretty quick, so I'm constantly plugging & unplugging. W/ this one, I just move it from one headstock to another & turn it on/off as desired...\", 'I have a Martin guitar and Martin strings are the only ones I use.', \"This stand is perfect.  For the price, it's hard to see why anyone would settle for cheaper.  The stand is stable and locks the guitar to the stand at the head stock. The locking mechanism senses weight and locks the guitar in place without extraneous adjustments.\", 'Ordered a \"MUGIG\" tuner, but received one with a \"Musedo\" brand mark. (See photo) Who is \"Musedo\", anyway?! I\\'m sure I\\'m correct in my assumption that these inexpensive tuners are mass-produced in China and receive all manner of brand name logos on them.', \"This is now the second pop filter I have purchased of this brand, and there has been one significant upgrade that I am jealous that my previous purchase of item didn't have. I have been setting up two separate recording PC's at home, and my son wanted a similar setup as I had. The first filter I had purchased still works and I liked its ease of use. I was pleasantly surprised to see the one thing I disliked about mine had been changed.\", 'I like these things. Bought 12 of them and Never had a problem. They come with drywall mounts as well as stud screws.  I always put into studs. Mutch safer than lots of stands that can fall over. Great price and solid.', 'These were perfect in every way for my application.  I installed these on a MIM stratocaster (I had to drill three holes in the tremolo plate to do so) and they were the correct NARROW string width ( 2 - 1/16\" ) for my application.  I was even able to top-load the strings through the holes where the intonation screws originally fed through, just to piss off the purists.  It worked so well that I am doing the same modification to another of my import strats, but this time with graph tech saddles.  Those ones will work as well, but I have to sand off some injection mold flaws first (although that will be easy as well).  I\\'m a believer in either brass or graphite when it comes to the break-angles of strings and these were literally perfect.', \"First of all these lights look great! The flashing patterns and bright lights really add pazaz to a party or get together as long as the lights are dimmed of course. The LX-5 has a built-in microphone which is used to match up the light flashes to the beat of a song playing, and this works very well as long as your speakers have a subwoofer (built in or external). I listened to some dubstep tracks while using this and I couldn't believe how accurate it was! The lights alternated between each color during the climb, and flashed in a unison strobe at the drop!\", 'I\\'m writing several different reviews here on Amazon to inform all of the shoppers that ALL of the low priced scissor arm mic stands on Amazon right now are the exact same model, just branded with the different logo. I actually picked up the \"neewer\" brand one because it said it came with an integrated XLR cable and a shock mount, but it did NOT, even when I exchanged it for another. Even the box said it has those accessories, but none were included.', 'The fender modern player stratocaster is a great guitar, I bought this guitar and modified it with chrome pickup covers and chrome knobs, it is a great looking and great sounding, I strongly recommend this guitar.', 'Absolutely amazing! I think they are direct knock-off of Seymour Duncan SH-2 Jazz Model Humbucker Pickups. (you can see the same little holes on each of pups) Powerful, bright sound, no noise. My old Johnson LP with ex \"EMG-ish\"  pickups are now fully awake and angry in a good way. Great quality! Thanks everyone for good review.', \"Thickest and most durable beater patch on the market. Buy this even if you don't use Aquarian heads. It'll prolong the life of any head!\", \"I recently got a used, but excellent, Epiphone Junior.  I've been playing for over fifty years and owned many -- many quite fine, costly, guitars. But as others have discovered, these older, P90-equipped Epis belie their cost. They play and sound GREAT.  With one exception: They come with pretty poor tuners.\", \"I have both Teles and Strats, and they both rite in this case perfectly. The extra storage areas are great, and you don't get outside storage pockets on a hard case.  The case is very well made, durable, and light.  I think the price for this product is a very good value. I know this will suit my needs perfectly!\", \"These are not bad for the price and have a good feel to them weight wise. I would say beginner sticks for sure but once you get to be a better drummer and you are learning how to make different sounds with your kit like a rim shot. These will snap off fast. It didn't take too long for my son to snap the tip off doing a rim/head hit. if these are for a electric kit, I would give these a 5 star for that perpose\", 'These are too thin to be effective on their own.  I love these for their color and overall aesthetics.', 'This is great. I bought for another reason but used it instead on my hihat and removed the legs which it is meant to do. Its more solid than with legs and less clutter. Now I have to buy another for the original purpose. I love it.', 'I\\'ve been using this little amp for over a month now and totally love it.  I run it into a small cabinet with a Jensen Vintage C8R4 8-inch ceramic speaker housed in a maple 12\" x 12\" cabinet and it sounds amazing.  If you closed your eyes you would think you were hearing a Fender Tweed combo from the 50\\'s.  I use a delay/reverb combo pedal in the effects loop insert and it\\'s as sweet as the larger setups I have in my main music room.  I use this in my office and it\\'s perfect for the space.  I can\\'t believe such vintage tones can come out of a chip-amp that is as small as a stomp pedal.  If you\\'re looking for extremely high gain, try one of the other Hotone amps like the Legacy British Invasion or Purple Wind.', \"Monster grips are a necessity for guitarists and bassists who demand that their pick has a grippy surface! They adhesive on them is very strong and will stick to picksp made of any material. I use them on carbon fiber picks, bone picks, brass pics & horn picks.  I've discovered that they are also handy for other things as well such as pictures and frames on my wall. One monster grip on the back corners of the picture frame will keep them from sliding crooked on the wall!\", \"It works!

The mic isn\\'t the best I have ever seen but for the price range it sure is good. I was skeptical but the XLR did come in handy. And it is heaps better than any built in microphone for any other webcam, laptop etc. The headphones are excellent, far better than any other headphones you\\'ll get for fifty bucks.', \"Judging from the reviews, the quality must be variable, but this one was a quick bolt-on. The neck was straight and even had the correct relief; frets were smooth and will require only minimum hand rolling of the ends. This one had the correct strat heel shape.  It is a beautiful fretboard with lots of character; the inexpensive nut was the right height and easy enough to replace.  I was able to brand it with my logo, give it a few coats of tung oil and put it on a handmade custom ordered offset guitar that I just finished in my workshop. I've ordered another.\", 'Nice heavy duty drawer.', 'Love it. Thick plastic. Good quality ez install.', \"Better than or equal to the higher priced competition. I've used the competition product and prefer this one. Plus the remote comes free, can't beat that.\", 'I was invited to play quasi-Dixieland banjo for a quasi-Dixieland musical (\"The Boy Friend\").  They told me my banjo wasn\\'t loud enough though I thought it was plenty loud. I didn\\'t want to mess with a mike since the sound guys never get that right.  Or with running a DI into the sound board for the same reason.  So I ordered this pickup from Amazon and installed it.  I ran it through a small Crate combo amp (XT65R); it was plenty loud - in fact I\\'ll be cutting it back tonight.  Sound was OK, would probably be better through an \"acoustic amp,\" but it\\'s good enough for the musical.', \"Looking at these on a guitar when they don't have a single wrap on the post, I found it hard to believe the strings would even stay on but I have now installed two sets of these on two different guitars. One black set and the other is gold. The first guitar would not stay in tune so I tried these. They have been on for nearly a year now and they totally fixed my tuning problem. The second set I put on my brand new Gibson Les Paul only because the first ones worked so well. Super easy fast string changes with the auto trim feature, and no tuning issues at all. At 18:1 gear ratio they dial in a perfect tune and hold it. I prefer these over Grover or any other higher priced tuners available.\", 'Superb built quality and sound. Seriously you pay for the Moog name but damn is it built solid.', \"I was hoping that these weren't cheap quality-wise, and they're not. They are perfect. Fits awesomely on my Shure SM58 and Peavey PV mics.\", \"Upgrading from a Numark Mixtrack Pro to this is night and day.  While I didn't buy it off amazon, I've attached my picture of the set up.

It doesn't look like it's on all the way, but this thing hasn't moved in almost a year!! I would highly recommend this product!!\", 'Truthfully, I had no idea that the even were ukulele capos. But why not? I use them on guitars and banjo, and there are certainly times when you might want to shift key without transposing so you can take advantage of open strings.', \"Cheap and effective. You'll need to print your own decals, but it's MUCH less expensive than the 70 bucks some other fool was trying to get out of us. They look great! Fits my Shure mics nice and snug. Will need to play with the SM57 a bit - not much room left to grab the mic with a foam screen. But we'll work through that.\", 'This happened (check out my picture) in about 3 to 6 months of use. I guess you by cheap, you get cheap results.', \"This pop filter works perfect and I like that it's easily adjustable. The images show a all black pop filter but I received a white and pink/purple filter. That's the only reason I'm going to give it 3 starts.

In doing this you need to utilize the piece that comes with your PR40 and secure your mic by screwing it to the bottom of your mic after putting it into the shock mount. Would of liked a natural fit without doing this but for the price it can't be beat and works very well.\", 'I diid an \"All Fender, All Over\" (as much as practical) upgrade to a $190 GFS Xaviere \"Tele\".  It came exceptionally well packaged an absolutely no flaws. Unlike the cover that came with the guitar, this one is non magnetic, which is a good thing. The GFS guitar is mostly vintage specs and this cover fit perfectly. Makes me wonder if some of the other reviewers got knock offs. I always buy original manufacturer stuff when doing a hardware upgrade, especially if it\\'s only a few bucks more. I\\'ve had my fill of trying to fit crappy, cheap, import stuff.

I hadn't picked up a fiddle in 50 years, so I didn't want to invest a lot of money in something I wouldn't use, but I was pleasantly surprised by this instrument. Of course it's not a high dollar violin, but there is nothing wrong with it.\", 'I own 3 of these Minis.  Quality on this one is the worst. Glue joints at the neck/body were messy. Had a couple of small dings (see photo of one under strings near bridge) but the important stuff is OK ( neck is straight and the bridge is sound). Fret edges are very smooth. Sounds great but not as good as the Ovangkol.', \"Okay, the idea is good, but the materials used are inferior. What good is a locking mechanism if the cheap plastic breaks off? The plastic part that the nylon strap is looped through broke clean off, right on stage. Luckily it was right at the end of a song as I played the last chord, and I held onto the guitar so it didn't go crashing down on the stage. But it could have, I was just lucky. Where the strap loops onto the plastic mechanism is the weak link. The locking part is a good idea. Not going to trust this thing with my instruments though. I had an old Ernie Ball spare strap in my case with simple leather ends. I will use it from now on.\", \"This guitar is far more beautiful in person. The red to gold tones blend so wonderfully and it has a barely visible tiger-stripe/wood pattern effect that I hadn't noticed prior to purchasing it. I got it here for a fraction of the price I was finding it other places. I have had no problems with it whatsoever yet, it plays easily and sounds like I spent a lot more on it than I did.

The main reason I bought this was to store my noisy external hard drive.  I can't do that now, so I guess this drawer is just going to hold random crap that I have on my desk.

The Behringer is a good value  it works fine and has good features / performance for the price  but like other Behringer products I've used, the sound quality / noise / distortion, leave me wanting a better product.

            "9 I have purchased 7 Donner guitar pedals recently  and I like the price of these pedals as well as the sounds quality of them. On several pedals the true bypass switch is loose and on another  pedal the same switch is slightly stiff. Due to the small size of these pedal, I was able to put 11 pedals total on a 12in12in plant caddy after removing the wheels.\n",
            "10 Thank you\n",
            "11 These pedals are great!! A friend of mine said I should buy other pedals because these pedals aren't manufactured by a very known brand name but I went with my own judgement and I was not disappointed with them. I have increased my speed a lot since I've gotten em and I can pedal songs like \"All Nightmare Long\" and \"Beast and the Harlot\" now  =]  great pedals. BUT, it takes time to develop speed so don't think the pedals suck just because you barely get em and you can't go all Jason Costa on em\n",

            "13 I like these microphpone windscreens and the price can't be beat. I have a few lavalier microphones and wanted to use them for recording outdoors. Unfortunately they are larger than what I would consider a lav mic windscreen. I have found they work best with my olympus me51s lav mic and they significantly reduced wind/ambient noise outside. The colors are nice and help in location them and not misplacing them. I have lost so many small black lav wind screens that if I had a dime...well you know the rest. I included a picture in the customer gallery so you can see beyond the stock photo what you're buying. I would recommend and just mention again, be aware of the size you're getting.\n",
            "14 The last drummer who played the USA Ludwig kit I my studio used a set of the black paint Vic Firth Steve Gadd signature stick and left black paint marks all over my white coated drum heads as black paint flecks all over. Luckily I already knew that a tiny bit Magic Eraser removes things like that from those drum heads.\n",
            "15 These stands are balanced, sturdy and lightweight. The locking strap is a nice feature but not even necessary. Not sure how some people are placing their guitars, but unless they have a defecting unit, it's pretty impossible to mess up. I use one for my Gibson Grabber bass and the other for my Taylor 114e acoustic. Works great for both!\n",
            "16 I have tried several violin strings and these are the ones I will buy again and again. Over all great even tone. Not to bright but clear.\n",
            "17 I've used this on a dozen flights and it's nice and hard, great for protecting my bow.\n",
            "18 I have been using these DR flatwound bass strings with a great deal of amazement.  I have installed these strings on two of my basses and I find them to be most excellent for my needs.  For one thing, these kind of strings are not \"fret eaters\" due to their flatwound smooth surface.  Also, they are lots easier on your fingers if you should play that way.  The various tones and behaviors that these strings produce is hard to describe, but it is a situation that very much agrees with me.  You almost have to hear them to really know.  I just got done installing a set of these DR's on a Reverend Thundergun 4 string bass and they sound awesome.  It might be noted that this bass has a 34\" scale neck and string through bridge.  I had no problems with installation or in tuning.  I am pretty much committed to these style of bass strings.  However a word of caution here.  These strings are not supposed to fit long scaled necks.  I shall conclude this review with 6 pictures.  5 stars on these strings for dang sure :)\n",
            "19 This strap is well made and is very comfortable. I installed Dunlop Straploks, which was a chore because the leather is so thick, but I got them on without cutting or modifying the strap. The leather is soft and the padding is nice. I bought another brand of leather strap that claimed it was padded but it wasn't. This strap is nice and cushiony. Highly recommended!\n",
            "20 It's great for my Taylor 150e 12-string guitar.... My only issue is that the wand it came with had a tear in the microfiber duster.\n",
            "21 Works so good that I didn't expect it to. The connected is not locked into any one position which means it's always turning so that can be a bit annoying. But once set, this small device delivers better than my amp. Was thinking of getting for a friend. I may just do so since it is this good\n",
            "22 My use for a guitar stand is primarily so my guitar actually gets played instead of sitting in it's case.  I love this stand!  It is stable and the pitch on it isn't so great for my Martin DC-15E that it takes up a lot of space.  I like that it doesn't have the higher piece that sits on the neck so it doubles as a decorative piece.  I couldn't be happier!\n",
            "23 So far I really love this tuner. Nice, large Brite screen, it's fully chromatic and your able to change the Hz for non standard tunings, like A 432, which I have actually tune songs recorded in. One issue, don't forget to turn it off as apparently if you don't, it will not shut down on its own due to inactivity and will drain the battery to zero.\n",
            "24 LOVE LOVE LOVE this controller. I use it with the free Serato software for professional gigs. Only downside is the microphone input which does not have much control. It was hard to get the right balance without feedback. I easily fixed this by using my amp input and external mixing board to control the mic levels.\n",
            "25 I have been using Fender locking tuners for about five years on various strats and teles. Definitely helps with tuning stability and way faster to restring if there is a break.\n",

The Xvive Sweet Leo O2 Distortion pedal is a great budget lead lead pedal. Im super impressed with the build quality and packaging from Xvive as well as the tones. If you are looking for a good lead distortion pedal that functions like how a tube amp works, you may want to consider this pedal. In this video I test it out on my Stratocaster (Partscaster) with humbucker pickups.\n",
            "27 It's hard to give less than 5 stars because this light is just an amazing value. It packs a serious punch in terms of output and feels quite sturdy. It has a very thin profile and the housing is a thick rugged plastic. Mounting hardware feels smooth and easy to adjust. The display on the back is larger than other lights of this style which is nice when configuring DMX channels. I control mine via a software DMX system, so I can't speak for the built-in modes. It has worked flawlessly in a DMX environment.\n",
            "28 I got these because I hate changing strings on a floating tremolo any more than I absolutely have to.... at first I thought I may have made a mistake because the tone was all off (super bright sounding on first installation).... played for a half hour and retuned, sounded better. Played for another half hour and retuned, sounded even better. Played for another few hours and they sound fantastic. Will update after I get a hundred hours on them (about 50 days from now). Will say that they handle bends very well and dive bombing deep on the trem hasn't hurt them yet.... VERY IMPRESSED\n",
            "29 The first one of these I used, did not work at all. After troubleshooting, I solder out the tone control and switched it for the volume pot that seemed to be shorted out perhaps from too much heat from the ground soldering on the back from the factory. Everything worked but there was still hum that I eliminated by running it through an effects pedal. The second one worked but had overwhelming static and hum, but it was cheap. I wired bypassing the controls, plugged it into a separate volume pedal and into an amp. It works fine now but with a little hum. I may still use these in the future because they are very inexpensive. I would use a better and more expensive pickups on better quality guitars. In the future, for one of my inexpensive projects, I would probably just order the pickup without the wiring harness and controls. But, rethinking, even buying an output jack and a bit of shielded cable at Radio Shack would have been more expensive in the end. You can't beat the price.\n",
            "30 Great idea, but unfortunately the clamp doesnt work correctly. You can only adjust it with the tab in the closed position, as opposed to the position shown in the instructions, defeating the easy on/off feature. Also the bracket that attaches the clamp to the cup holder uses a single screw, which loosened up while I was trying to attach the clamp to a mic stand. I was able to tighten it up, but I needed to remove the bracket in order to do so. Further, even after tightening this screw, the bracket still had a tendency to swivel.\n",
            "31 They're pretty perfect for my violins, but I have to readjust them often\n",
            "32 This is a great little gadget. Being a lead Guitarist I,m always look for a new sound. This little reverb works great working with all My other pedals. I highly recommend this one to all My other Guitarist friends out there. ~Pepper~ Austin Texas\n",
            "33 Works well! And the free guitar picks don't hurt. Looks nicer than a standard silver/black capo, and functions just as well. Have used it for a few weeks now with no problems.\n",
            "34 Easy to fit to my violins top with a good sharp knife and some patience, need to get some better sand paper to make it a perfect fit. Please note this is not a bridge you can unpack and simply insert you must fit the feet to your violins top. Really enjoy the curve of the strings as well. All in all a great step up from the factory fit bridge that came on my instrument.\n",
            "35 I'd give it 5-stars if it was filled-in around the connector (cleaner look and easier to hit in the dark).  Otherwise it was a great solution to cleanly put  an access port on the front of my portable recording rig.  I have lots of USB-A to USB-B cables about, so that connected me to a standard USB audio interface inside the rack also with a B connector.  I already had another B-to-A adapter like this for a USB charging jack that is reversed, with the A-B cable on the inside going to a standard USB charger.\n",
            "36 My husband got Guitar Hero for Christmas and on a whim added one of these hangers to his wish list.  One of our friends got it for us, almost as a joke-- but then we mounted it and realized how handy it was!  It works wonderfully for our little plastic guitar, saves it from getting scratched up in the closet, and looks pretty darn cool.  Highly recommended!\n",
            "37 For the price, these claves sound amazing.  I wanted a natural wood tone as an alternative to the piercing, higher pitch of my fiberglass LP King claves.  These did the trick.  Amazing value.\n",
            "38 Great replacement. 3 ply and made very well. As good as the Fender parts. NOTE: This is for the made in Mexico (MIM) or Fender American Standard Stratocaster. Please read all the specs on the website description. See a lot of people complaining it doesn't fit their Strat. Well it's because it wasn't made for their model. This will NOT fit a Squier or Roadhouse, Deluxe. Do your homework and you won't land up with the wrong pickguard.\n",

            "42 a little higher up than I thought it would be, but nice that I got my pedal board running a little under my amp, now i don't kick my amp when i go to switch effects.  Wish there was more adjustability but it is what it is, one of the more affordable stands can't be asking too much.  The back power plug socket on my amp (Bugera v5) barely interferes with the back bar of the stand (bottom of the plug hitting top of the bar) but I got the weight of the amp slightly resting on it and I don't think it's severe enough that it's a danger.  Stand won't be moved around much so  I expect it to last for a long long time.\n",
            "43 This is a great option for creating a lively, party-like atmosphere. It lights up with many different colors and can be used for many different environments. Its very portable and I like that there is very little set-up involved.\n",
            "44 These strings are wonderful. My go to strings have been the Gibson Bill Monroe, however amazon does not stock those currently. So I decided to give these a try because they are the same gauge and phosphorus bronze just like the Gibson. These sound just as good if not better than the Gibson BM strings. They are warm, bright and very projecting. They have that signature bluegrass sound that you hear on the classics. I love these strings!\n",
            "45 I like this pedal cause it's similar to Mesa sound...Love JOYO\n",
            "46 Best strap lock system out there! -\n",
            "47 For the price of tunable bongos you get 3 roto-toms and a stand.  An inexpensive way to expand your current drum set.\n",
            "48 I think that this is a great product (because it is for a complete keyboard), but I do have one tiny, tiny problem... They are so tiny that I can't see them.  I looked at many vendors for this type of product and because yours ran the full gambit, I chose it.  If you have any that are larger and has all 88 keys, I'll trade with you!\n",
            "49 I bought this to fit into an Ibanez Edge Tremolo. It was a little different to figure out, but once you get it fine tuned and set up right it worked absolutely perfectly. My trem was blocked so I didn't have to worry about it interfering with the recessed route.\n",
            "50 this uke sounds so good! it is my favorite out of all my other expensive ones! i can't believe i got it for 40.00$!!\n",
            "51 Took a little while to arrive, but it's good quality!...put this on a subRay 4 bass pick guard fits but the hole don't line up 100%, but that doesn't bother me\n",
            "52 If you want some fun or you are having a down day (and who doesn't some times)...just get this! It is so much fun. Turn on your favorite music and turn this on by simply plugging it on a wall outlet and watch the light show - just fantastic, if you like bright colorful lights. The colors vary and change depending on the sounds from your own music. These are LEDs so very little electricity is used. You can place this table top or hang it on a wall.\n",
            "53 I was pleasantly surprised with this Hankey ukulele. It looks beautiful the neck is great the sound is great acoustic and electrically with amp or pa. Well worth the money worth the money. I'm very happy with my investment. I highly recommend this awesome Ukulele. ;)\n",
            "54 My ES*335 fit loose and needed some padding added to keep the guitar snug, but if you don't mind doing that it's a good deal...\n",
            "55 Just what I needed, although at it's lowest setting, wass about an inch too tall for me sitting on the edge of my bed. Ive gotten used to it now so it's all good! Like others have said, it's good quality and sturdy construction. I stubbed my toe on it in The night, and quickly wished that hadn't happened! The rubber grip on top is actually riveted on, so that should last a good while. I also used this for when I practice standing up. I rest my foot on it which pushes the bottom of my guitars out so I can see what I'm doing. All in all its a good product and I recommend it. A word of warning, this is made of strong metal, if you're buying this for your son or daughter, show them the dangers of the scissoring action of the legs. I imagine they could do some hurtin to little fingers.\n",
            "56 This pedalboard is the best value entry level board ive seen on amazon.... Very well made, sits on floor with a good angle, very useful slats and spacing to make cables tidy underneath so you can organise the pedals in a non linear fashion  .  Its big enough to grow into. Love the lightweight aluminum. Velcro straps come with it to strap on your mini power supply (donner psu no less lol).  I also hid my noise suppressor underneath since thats an always-on pedal.  This way, you get even more pedal space on top. I fit all my pedals and probably room for one or two mini pedals or one more regular sized pedal.\n",
            "57 Adding some twang to my Jim Dandy campfire guitar.\n",
            "58 The flute came in good shape, but there are two holes in the under side bottom, toward the end, with both holes connecting to one another at a 45 degree angle.  There's no way to cover these holes and play the flute.  I'm guessing it's a manufacturing mistake, where someone got a little too happy with the hole drilling!!\n",
            "59 It's bigger than I expected and when you pull it out of the box it comes in it has this square shape. LOL. I like it and will hold on to the box just for that. Fits perfectly easy on off. The black area is rubber. I thought it would be foam. Pretty good at wind protection. No popping. It looks good with the H4N Pro. A few loose hairs and sheds a little bit but hopefully all the loose ones with be gone after a little while.\n",
            "60 I would give this 2.5 stars. The reason they disappointed me somewhat is that the squares have a degree of variability to them. See my picture. Some are taller than others, some are more grey others more black. And even after sitting a few days there were still dents in them. They worked but after buying 96 of these I wanted more uniformity.\n",
            "61 This added the je ne sais quoi to my PA sound.\n",
            "62 Fantastic case I got for a great price.  Thank you Amazon for saving me $70 on this one item as compared to Musician's Friend or Sweetwater.  I had several guitars I could use this with but it fit the one I was hoping it would a Schecter OMEN-8.\n",
            "63 Quite possibly the nicest guitar straps on the market.\n",
            "64 I installed these myself using the Elenco Electronics ST-12 Soldering Tool Kit on a 2012 Fender American Stratocaster. I didn't like the Custom Shop Fat 50's that were installed. I wanted something that could growl, that was noiseless but still kept the chime of the king tone and these pickups deliver. I adjusted them a couple of times (not too high) and may have found the sweet spot. I don't change pickups too often but the fat 50's sounded too farty and muffled to my ears. I also like to play a wide range of styles ranging from Jeff Beck jazz to Yngwie Neoclassical to John Mayer blues. These pickups are able to handle those styles easily. Most importantly they are dead silent and that's important when you're doing a lot of recording.\n",
            "65 With a much needed modification, this became a far more durable board.\n",
            "66 Guys, this is a really good sounding pedal.  It has enough highs-lows-mids to make you smile.  The sound is similar to pedals costing much more.  Of course, everything is based on taste and the kind of music you play.  This is not a super scooped metal pedal.  It's best for strong overdrives and smooth grudge sounds.  The big factor about this pedal compared to more expensive pedals is that it doesn't like HEAT.  I had a gig in Detroit on a metal stage with a 100 degree PLUS day.  The pedal didn't like it at all.  My BOSS Blues driver was just fine.  Of course the Blues Driver is a $100 pedal. It took the temps just fine. So, that is, in my opinion, the big difference between what you get with JOYO vs other, more expensive, pedals.  Keep in mind, if you are not playing in 100 degree temperatures you have nothing to fear. So, rock on and enjoy your music!!\n",
            "67 Just upgraded to this board and I am very happy I did. I needed more stereo inputs and this one had 4 of them. When it comes to an internet radio station you need a clean quiet board. I have no noise coming out of this board so I am very pleased. Plus I needed the AUX outs for my TelosONE set up. Everything is working perfect!\n",
            "68 I do wish some reviewers would do a little basic research into what they are buying before posting negative comments. This neck plate is a high quality replacement for the plate that comes standard on newly-manufactured US Strats (and probably Teles). I purchased this to update the look of my '97 \"weird, fat logo\" neck plate and am very pleased with the results. The material appears to be aluminum or aluminum alloy with a chrome finish, in contrast to the heavier steel that it replaced. I did not bust out the calipers but it is at least as thick as the older version. It is not plastic, nor pot metal. It comes with screws. For giggles, I stopped by Guitar Center after installing it and yep...all American Standard Strats have this exact same neck plate.\n",
            "69 This strap is advertised for a mandolin, but I put it on my ukulele. I found guitar straps (usually 2 inches wide) and even dedicated ukulele straps (usually 1.5 inches wide) to be too bulky and uncomfortable. This strap is only 3/8\" inch wide, but my ukulele is so lightweight that I really don't need anything wider and a narrower strap doesn't get in the way of my arms and hands. Installing this strap without removing my ukulele strings took some effort. I had to unthread the strap loop (which is really much tighter than it needs to be), then thread the strap end under my ukulele strings, then thread it back through the strap loop (which is still much tighter than it needs to be). The plastic buckle in the middle of the strap is not removable, so you need to thread that through strap loop and it is a real tight fit. Once installed, the strap works great. The thin soft-ish cotton is more comfortable on my shoulder than thick leather or stiff nylon strap and it doesn't seem to scratch my ukulele wood at all.\n",
            "70 If you're looking for an inexpensive party light, this is a great option.  The beams are pretty tight and is really set off with a fog machine.  The speaker inside was shocking at first (when you plug it in there is a commanding voice talking about bluetooth connectivity.)  There is a little wireless remote that is useful within 10 feet or so.  The motor is a bit loud but with music playing you won't notice.\n",
            "71 I Purchased this unit primarily for sweetening up a violin pickup and an acoustic guitar with an LR Baggs pickup. I'm highly impressed with the improvement in the acoustic guitars tone and character. The parametric equalizer is fantastic for dialing in perfect tone. The unit is dead quiet, the only noise noted was when I tightened up the bandwidth and boosted level into the upper 3rd of its range on the parametric eq. In microphone applications the unit performs equally well and the low cut worked great for reduction of handling noise. This is a fantastic tool at a bargain price. I own an ART tube MP preamp also and this unit is definitely a solid step up from the MP. Thanks to Behringer for making great quality affordable products for musicians on a budget. The only knock I can come up with at this point is that the manual is extremely basic and if you're a new user of mic pre's you're kind of on your own. It would be nice if they had included some application recommendations for basic settings,\n",
            "72 I previously purchased the 20' cable for my SG and Marshall amp, and I was very satisfied. I have a couple of pedals with different variations that I wanted to incorporate, and the old saying \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\" came to mind. So I ordered 2 of the 6' cables to complete my personal set up. You can't go wrong with these. Great Cords!\n",
            "73 Love this stuff so far. Looks awesome and I can definitely hear the difference acoustically. Hoping I don't run into the blue / green issue that other reviewers have seen.\n",
            "74 Love the beefy strings.  Depending on the style of music you play, you might want to give the heavier strings a spin around the block.  If you're on full-tilt distortion all the time, you probably won't see a difference, but if you play without a lot of pedals and like that slightly crunchy breakup to come from your amp, the Beefy strings can make a big difference.\n",
            "75 Another update. How can you sell these to people! I have a craft show this weekend and i went to put these tumers on and none id the screws fit! First one i didn't realize and it got stuck. I had to use two pliers to pull it off and scratched mlthe new neck i just finished making. Your company shpuld not be selling these! I now hqve to run out and find somewhere to but 6 sets ....Update....i ordered more, they came in odd. The top is too wide that the nuts don't fit!\n",
            "76 As I said elsewhere, the pick wears on the edges, and breaks very quickly, within hours if you play hard. I use it on an acoustic guitar with Medium to Light strings, so really! After at least 3 years, I am still using my Dunlop medium guitar pick. The rubber part also \"hangs\" on the low E string, especially if you are trying to hit it for the first beat of the measure or simply for emphasis. This is probably a bad habit, which I could unlearn, but only if the pick would last longer!\n",
            "77 Works great as a guitar bench mat. Not rugged enough for abuse but if you take care of it, it will take care of you. Makes organization of workspace much easier because screws won't roll around. Color is good too.\n",
            "78 I ordered these for my Road Worn Player Tele,  They fit perfectly. no more winding strings and my tuning problems have been resolved!!!!!!!!!!\n",
            "79 Everything met my expectations the product was good quality, easy to install even without directions included and my guitars look great hanging on the wall. I read negative reviews saying that the quality was crap and it took them an hr to get it threaded onto the base. Unless you have no basic knowledge of being handy this will not be a problem just make sure you find a stud on the wall and screw the included screws through the drywall and securely into the stud. Before you do this  run the  screw that attaches to the base through the threads to avoid any issues like the negative reviewer had. After you attach the base to the wall thread in the guitar hanger screw firmly and you are good to go. I personally would easily buy one of these for the price of 2 they are great quality for the price and if you have more than one guitar to hang then this product is a must buy!!!!\n",
            "80 I purchased two of these to hang guitars in my music room. These are well made and certainly do the job okay. However, I completely did NOT trust the two skimpy screws they provided to hang this unit. They are basically drywall screws, but these have a rather skinny diameter. I was not about to trust my vintage P-Bass to a skinny screw inside a hollow-wall fastener. No, I used a heavier \"construction screw\" directly into a wall stud. See photo. I was seriously concerned that the supplied skinny screw would actually break off in the stud. If you are hanging a lightweight acoustic, then the supplied hardware should be fine. I'm probably just being paranoid and overly cautious.  Other than that, I like it (tho walnut piece could be a little bigger in my opinion).\n",
            "81 Great, lightweight product that easily replaces some of my older lighting that's nearly eight times the size and weight.  Having two synced with a DMX cable easily fills the room.  The extra colors not available in many of the big name lights is great addition (orange, purple and white).  Only time will tell how reliable they are.  I'm not a big fan of the white house (which glows), but aside from that, they're perfect.\n",
            "82 Bag itself seems to be nice enough, certainly the stand fits. The strap failed me and broke upon first use, not even with heavy weight in it. The carabiner slipped out of the socket thing. I don't know how to explain it, all I know is I had to replace the strap altogether.\n",
            "83 I bought this bcos it was cheap. The fastener is difficult to unclip due to its tiny size. I have small hands. I like it better if the strings are shorter, so it won't dangle. So far it serves me well\n",
            "84 This is nominally a violin/viola stand, but due to the length and neck diameter, also works well as a mandolin stand. My Paris Swing mandolin fits nicely into the Auto Grip holder. An added bonus is that my Irish bodhran (18\" frame drum) rests comfortably on top of the Auto Grip assembly, with the bottom of the rim resting against the padded legs as does the body of a stringed instrument.\n",
            "85 This thing kicks some serious butt. An excellent, deep, thumping subwoofer. It really rounds out our sound. The first day I got it I ended up with a sheriff in my front yard asking me to turn it down. :)\n",
            "86 Perfect fit on my Epiphone LP 100.... My beginner guitar.  Had to decide if I wanted to sell my LP-100 after upgrading to an LP Standard.  Decided to keep LP 100 for sentimental reasons but wanted to get rid of Cream colored trim.  Swapped out cream colored pick-up trim and the poker chip for Black ....love it\n",
            "87 I manage a classic rock band. I recently ordered a bunch of stuff to replace aging gear. Cables, mics, stands, snakes, etc. We have now been out on a couple of gigs with the stuff. It is all good quality and working fine. Does exactly what I expected it to do. No surprises. In the interest of time I am applying this exact same review to all of the items I bought for this purpose and am happy with. FWIW, I am also taking the time to be critical of the items I am not completely happy with.\n",
            "88 this pedal is for marshall amps it with a e.q. and compressor made a awsome metal skull ripping tone I was thinking of a voodo mod but a friend told me about the pedal and man its got more than enough gain  i mean lots of distortion it and eq compressor makes for a great combo  so get rid of all the tube screamers and go to the turbo rat if you got a marshall\n",
            "89 Competitors had detailed drawings and better pictures causing me to worry I'd made a mistake with these. Luckily, when I tried to cancel, I was too late. These dandies hold the pickguard firmly and even better-the correct countersink, satiny color & flatish profile make them nearly disappear into the pickguard. PERFECTION!\n",
            "90 There is not any noise during use, and not heating with 8 pedals powered on running for 5 hours, the voltage of each channel keeps the same. Stable power supplying. With 7 X 9V 100mA +1 X 9V 500mA+1 X 12V 100mA+1 X 18V 100mA can work for at least 10 pedals easily. 10X50 cm cables are long enough to reach any part of the pedal board. Small size, and will not taking up too much pace. The Polarity Reversal Cable can help you cope with different pedals. Stable output and cost-effective. Provides 10 power outputs, it is able to work for a standard pedalboard. But the price is not so expensive as the Voodoo Lab or T-Rex, etc, you can easily have a power supply to work for your own pedals. I am quite satisfied with the price and stability overall it is very worth having. NO HUM! EXCELLENT POWER! GET ONE!\n",
            "91 For the money this pedal is great but you really need to use a noise gate with it, the background hiss is almost unbearable when when activated and not playing.\n",
            "92 I didn't realize they were so short, but they still worked perfectly.\n",
            "93 Bought it as a gift for my brother, but got to play around with it for a couple of days. Sounds great, doesn't go out of tune too much, but I read that is normal in new instruments so no worries there.\n",
            "94 Tiny little amp. I have never seen these in my retail shops. I just ordered from here. After putting in a 9V battery and plugged in my Gretsch guitar, instantly I heard the punching sound of rockabilly. Never did I ever heard any strange sounds of feedback or popping or screeching. It was quiet and perfect for me even when I played it real close to the amp. I did not purchase the DC adaptor, just relying on batteries. Imagine I could play electric guitar in my car, how portable is this thing! The bad thing about this is that the box packaging looks cheap and printing was bad. The brand name of the amp is located at its back, kind of shy of telling others it's Fender. At first I suspected it was fake. However the sound doesn't lie. I realized this amp cost more than the others, not sure if other brands are equally good as well.\n",
            "95 This happened (check out my picture) in about 3 to 6 months of use. I guess you by cheap, you get cheap results.\n",
            "96 No the best sound but for practice along without disturbing the neiborhoods is the cheap and best option...\n",
            "97 I LOVE this thing. It works as a VOLUME pedal, WAH pedal and EXPRESSION pedal, all in one. Also, the WAH sounds amazing. The small size of the top plate makes it a breeze to use and pull off all kinds of things that are much more difficult with a full size wah.  In short, it's built like a tank, sounds amazing and looks great :)\n",
            "98 Don't care what anyone says, these things are great. I've completely upgraded my lighting with just two of these. Nice and bright, easy to setup master and slave and very durable if treated with care and properly stored/transported.\n",
            "99 This would be my fourth Ocarina Wind ocarina. It is by far my FAVORITE. I love the \"Sound of Earth\" design. The mouthpiece is perfectly sized. The body design is very comfortable and feels natural to hold. The rough finish makes it feel sturdy and adds some nice grip! The slight indent at the subholes makes it very easy and comfortable to use them. (My trumpet creeper ocarina's subholes are a pain, and the \"rythym of the earth\" are a little close, I am always hitting them on accident!) It is also the most in tune, all notes! It has a great, mellow but resonating sound. I would love to see more aesthetics with this body design! I truly was surprised. I have 3 other ocarinas from them that are more than reasonably priced for decent product, but this one in particular blew my expectations out of the water! I definitely recommend this for any level, especially beginner at this price. It is worth much more than what it is being sold for! I actually bought another!\n",
            "100 All I have to do is install this on my Strat. Instructions gave me a good idea of what needs to be done, and I have experience with all kinds of stuff since I was involved with all types of Proto-Typing in many different machine shops so it should be a fun project.\n",
            "101 I play guitar with a flat pick. But I also play ukulele, and hard picks can make the uke sound a little harsh. I've tried felt uke picks, but they never felt comfortable. So I use one of these Alaska Pik Fingerpicks over my index finger for strumming. Size is important. I have medium sized hands, and these picks can slip off my fingertip when it's hot and muggy, like when I'm playing at an outdoor market. That can cause some awkwardness when trying to strum, sing and keep the pick from flying off my finger. I might try the next size smaller in the future. But this is the best pick I've found for getting a loud, round sound out of my uke.\n",
            "102 I absolutely love these!! I bought these colorful wind screens for my karaoke microphones. I have received many compliments from family and friends!! Definitely worth the price. It took a little while to get here, but worth it!! I noticed other reviews stating they didn't get the same colors as pictured. I received the right colors!\n",
            "103 I have always hated tuners; I would rather use tuning fork on the A string and go from there. Most tuners are too cumbersome and require large batteries or external power(pedals). In addition I couldn't use those on my acoustics. Snark solves all of these problems. The display is colorful and easy to read and hides neatly behind the headstock. There is also a visual tap metronome that shows a beating heart in sync with the tempo. I can easily move it from electric to acoutic, and Amazon's pricing is so low I am considering getting one for each of my guitars. This is one of the few 5 star ratings I've given any product on Amazon and I rate a lot.\n",
            "104 Excellent product fit perfectly in my Epiphone pr-5. I think it did change the sound a little bit, it has more sustain. Very nice look.\n",

            "107 This microphone is durable, loud, and clear. I got this to improve the sound of the Blowing Up podcast and it did wonders for cutting back on noise.  I've also used it for live sound and actually like it more than my SM-58.  It also looks and feels very nice, if you care about that.\n",
            "108 These are heavy and feel pretty sturdy. They fit sturdy and were easy to install. They are darker than in the pics in the product discription. The color is black chrome.\n",

When I unplugged it, the actual quarter inch end broke off as I was pulling the cable out as I normally do at the end of practicing or a show, and got stuck in my amp so thanks to this, I have to spend money and time that I don't have to get my amp fixed with the broken cable and buy a better, stronger, more durable cable that won't break when I pull it out of the amp.\n",
            "110 I love this guitar. You can have a clean tone or a crunch tone which is perfect for what I play. It was my first bass and I got it at a local used gear shop. I have had it for a little over a year and it has been through a lot. It sounds great and it is REALLY durable and can go through a lot. I have played this bass every where I have played\n",

After about a month of playing they still sound fairly new, I think they sound good, feel good, and have even response up and down and across the fretboard.\n",
            "114 I have to give these pickups 5 stars for bang for buck!  I bought this last year for an 96' Korean Squire that I have been slowly but surely replacing everything on as a learning project.  Time marched on and I finally put them in tonight and all I have to say is Wow!  The difference in these and the originals is just off the scale.  I never realized how much amp hiss I was getting until I plugged these in for the first time.  I had to actually hit a string to make sure it was working.  I can not say enough good things about these affordable pickups.  I have another MIM strat with some boutique pickups that are marketed as noiseless but I honestly believe I actually like the tone of these better for a fraction of the cost. If you have an old Strat laying around these are the pickups you need to bring it roaring back to life.  I have attached a pic for those who wonder how the covered pickups look installed.\n",
            "115 Bought these for my Peavey Raptor Plus EXP that I'm currently rebuilding. The screw was a bit longer than the one that was for the original string tree, so it took a bit longer and had to use a little bit of elbow grease to fully get it screwed it. But once it was tight, it looks great and matches the rest of the gold hardware on the guitar. I would recommend this to anyone looking to build a Partscaster, upgrade the string trees, or do as I'm doing and getting all gold hardware for their guitar.\n",
            "116 Solid , not flimsy, bright colors. Some of the uv coating pulled away while removing the protective film. A small setback I hope to have replaced soon or not, Product Pride?.....meh. Customer Service...???\n",
            "117 I bought 4 to use for my pedal board that I just made. Upon opening the first one, it was not one continuous piece. It was cut towards one end and as I unrolled it, a shower of the black mushroom nubs came falling out (see picture). Hmm...maybe just a bad roll. I opened the second one. This one was one continuous piece, and only a few nubs fell out. Ok, lets test it out. I attached it to itself and pressed it together. Nice grip. Then I pulled it apart, and several bunches of nubs came tearing out as well. If I'm going to attach something to my pedal board that will bond permanently, I don't want  something that will tear itself apart and leave bald patches every time I move a pedal. I'm sure it would work fine, if you don't move things around, but just the idea that I can't do it do often doesn't sit well. Oh well, expensive lesson learned. Get the 3M instead. I have used it in the past. Good stuff.\n",
            "118 Works easy to set up\n",
            "119 We needed to upgrade the Hot Hitz Radio mixer. We needed the AUX sends to properly work a Telos ONE which places listener phone calls on the air. Our old mixer did not have this option so it was time to upgrade. This is a great mixer and the price was really good if you are on a budget. We use this mixer in a studio.\n",
            "120 Its a good sound for the price that you're paying. I really enjoy playing on this little guy daily and so far its holding up, it shows no sigh of warping.\n",
            "121 Knox Gear Z heavy duty piano stand is made with Quality craftsmanship.\n",
            "122 I bought this item because it had good reviews and it was cost effective compared to the top name brands. So far I have only used this item in a practice setting, but it does exactly as it states. I have noticed if the product is left on for several hours it gets a little warm, but it doesn't seem to be any sort of issue\n",
            "123 I bought this 2 months ago and just now got a chance to put it on my Tele but it does NOT fit! It's too small and the holes don't match!\n",
            "124 Actually really like this piece...for what I needed it fits the bill. Buttons are solid, the fader works as it should and it's a solid build. Pay attention to the set up instructions, esp for Ableton and all will be fine. Very happy with my purchase.\n",

These fit the bill and I'm happy with the end result.\n",
            "126 The design of this tool is great overall. I like the flexibility of it, and it does its job well. You are going to hear less sibilance from the vocals that are being recorded. I definitely will recommend this to every artist and/or mixing engineer to get a clean, quality recording. Its cheap, so the price will not be a big problem for you. You see a pop filter in most studios these days, and don't worry about yours not being the most expensive or the most advanced. Most of the time, you can get the same job done with the equipment you have. So keep it up. This project won't let you down.\n",
            "127 Beautiful case with great padding and fit. The case is snug and absolutely perfect for my flamenco guitar. It fits so nicely, it seems as if it were custom made for standard flamenco/classical guitars. I highly recommend this case. Quality inside, outside, and nice latches with two keys and a lock.\n",
            "128 Great quality patch cables!\n",
            "129 These locking tuners look great and keep tune.  Good quality materials and construction.  Excellent upgrade to any guitar.  I had to drill additions holes for installation.  If your neck already comes with pre-drilled holes, then they should drop right in, otherwise you will need to buy a guitar tuner pin drill jig, also available from Amazon.\n",
            "130 I just finished installing 12 of these and couldn't be any happier with the product.  It is a sturdily built product with EVERYTHING you need for installation.  I didn't think this was possible, but I actually found a product MADE IN THE USA !!!  I will definitely buy more of these as my guitar collection grows.\n",
            "131 I purchased this SSL-1 RWRP to use in the middle position of my MIM Strat that I converted into a poor man's version of the David Gilmour black Strat and am very happy with the tone. The only negative is that it doesn't come with a cover.\n",
            "132 Finally a cheap neck that is as advertised!!!\n",
            "133 This tenor ukulele case is great. Love the color (red) as well as the burgandy colored padded interior. This case is very sturdy and well made. All four latches close securely. There is an extra piece of removable padding on the inside that I placed along the side of my ukulele for a very nice, snug fit. I was looking for a hard case that had a pair of backpack straps, which this model does. I don't know if all the colors have that, but I was told that the red, white and champagne colored cases have the removable backpack straps. The straps are also nicely padded. Really if there was anything I would find fault with is that it is a rather heavy case, being fiberglass. But that's a price I'm happy to pay for the bombproof security this case affords my expensive Pono ukulele.\n",
            "134 This was an eBay buy to flip. Not a bad Bass guitar. Just not worth much, used or new. The bridge pickup is very noisy. The pickups are not an active pickup. If they were an Active pickup without the BOOM sound, then I would say its a 4 star. Everything is about the same as the GSR200 as far as body, neck, and bridge. Mine was a $79 buy new and a $119 flip. Its an ok Bass guitar after a string change and a setup. This is more of a first time Bass buyer who is learning to play.\n",
            "135 This black guard fit perfectly on my squier affinity telecaster that I was doing my rendition of macawber(Keith Richards telecaster). Very impressed with how well it was made. I just had to file out the pickup hole just a little bit for it to fit with ease. But all mounting screw holes lined up and I didn't have to do any fit work that you have to do most of the time, even on more expensive pick guards sometimes. I am very happy with how it looks and fits, I do really like the matte finish of it too.\n",
            "136 I'm using this brilliant connector from my iPad retina (running a sequencing app) to a Roland MC-303. Works perfect. Having this connector opens up a whole world of new tech and old tech compatibilities. I'm sure it works great for using USB controllers for Midi as well, since that's really what it was designed for. If you are looking to incorporate your iPad into Midi world, get this now.\n",
            "137 I bought It to replace my Squier II's bridge, It has improved the resonance and sustain, the item was described as \"Mexi\" so I thought It was made in Mexico, but It's made in Taiwan... Anyway It's a genuine Fender part and now with a few dollars my guitar sounds better.\n",
            "138 I'm a long time musician, and a long time user of Ernie Ball Strings (on electric guitars). Unfortunately, I can't endorse these strings, even though they sound great and the light gauge saves my fingers. The problem is that they break, in my humble opinion, excessively easily. I put a set on and broke a g string within 2 days of moderate use. It snapped near the saddle, so I didn't think much of it. I replaced the set, and within a few more days I noticed that the wrapping on the g string was broken and becoming unraveled near my third fret. I bought 7 sets, so I still have 5 more sets to go through, but honestly I'll probably go back to elixirs when these are gone, since they seem to last longer.\n",
            "139 This is legit everybody is may only be 20$ but it's plug and play no special knobs or knobs just get your phantom 48v and your ready ... This is used for like the floureon mic or the Neewer mic or the Tonor mic they all work with this\n",
            "140 As I am sure that you know, this is a Fulltone OCD clone and let me tell you that it is the closest to a perfect clone in sound as you can get. I love this pedal and because of this one will probably be buying many more Joyo products. I wasn't a huge fan of the paint job on the product so I pulled it apart and used ceramic resin engine paint to coat it. I love this pedal and would recommend it to anyone!\n",
            "141 We installed ours at the heel of the neck having ordered extra guitar strap buttons. My wife loves it on her new Alvarez AU90T tenor uke. She immediately contrasted the soft cotton fabric with an old synthetic guitar strap I had pulled out.\n",
            "142 I bought this bag for my double kick pedals.  It's a great bag for that purpose.  The pedals fit perfectly, and the fur lining helps protect them .  The exterior pocket is perfect for the beaters, link bar, and any other accessories you need.  I would highly recommend this bag to anyone looking for an inexpensive way to transport and protect your double pedals.  The only thing I would like to see added to it is a divider between the pedals.\n",
            "143 Fit my 2007 MIUSA Strat which I purchased gutted and I'm slowly getting parts for. I just got the switch and machine heads and I still need the Pick-Ups. Since it's an 07 I felt that I could hot rod with out getting ostracized for it. I'm also going to do a hand carved inlay on the body. The guitar is being built for a give away to commemorate 19 years serving Indie Music. The image is a 1977 Fender MusicMaster MIUSA, the part I got is the same going on a Fender Strat\n",

Most reviews I've seen recommend new strings and a different bow, neither of which I had. The bridge was already set in place. So, on Christmas morning, she popped in a 9v battery, tuned it up with the existing strings, rosined up the bow that came with it and plugged it into a small amplifier, which resulted in the attached video.\n",

Also has aux return inputs that can be used as extra stereo inputs and be volumed by the aux return knobs.\n",

            "148 The quality of this bass trap is amazing. I record all kinds of music and when mastering a song with heavy bass leads I need to hear it as clearly as possible. This works perfectly. I have trouble hearing someone speaking on the other side of the room. I may have over done it, but the room is so muffed from any sound its almost erie... Well worth the money! By the way, when I'm not recording I use this room to play Xbox One on. The bass is so crisp and clear. Its better then a movie theater!\n",

            "150 This light is awesome!!! Very bright with 54 one watt diodes. Throws a nice medium wash they are great. The only down side I have with them is a power cable being attached to the fixture instead of an iec cable. It has dmx in and out. The housing is a very tough plastic and also includes the hanging bracket. The par is a flat par which is great for up lighting. I think this is a great fixture so I give it a 5 stars\n",
            "151 Simply beautiful. Excellent quality. It is a bit long since Im only 5 and play with my guitar fairly high up. I just cinch it as much as itll go and its just right.\n",
            "152 Arrived in 2 days with prime in safe packaging. Minor paint flaws with semi gloss finish. Plywood and plastic construction with painted plastic fretboard. Has plastic tuning keys and metal tuning gears on headstock. Paint wore away quickly on the side of fretboard at the top of the neck. The strings on the ukulele are not of quality but the ukulele can take brand name strings and tune them correctly. The bridge and nut need filing in order to effectively play chords or scales so I would consider it a novelty uke. Perfect for a toddler or young child to use instead of an expensive instrument, but will not be good to learn on or take lessons with. False spruce top and stained mahogany back and sides give it an expensive look that kids will love. Adult supervision required as there are moving parts. I bought this for my son who is turning two years old this May. See photo for comparison of an acoustic guitar (spruce top, catalpa back and sides) vs. the soprano ukulele\n",
            "153 Very nice product! Really really love it! I hope these last long time! Highly recommended! Better effect with a fog machine!\n",
            "154 This is a great idea and I was surprised at how well the suction cup adheres to my guitar's surface.  However, if you are going to rely on it for a gig, then I would attach at least two as your hand or any brushing against something firm can knock it off.  In other words, it isn't as sticky as adhesive.  But, for most situations, it certainly does the trick and can removed in an instant and does not deface the guitar surface in any fashion.  It does come with a medium thickness, pink pick that is halfway decent.  While I am not crazy about the color, I quickly realized that it is easy to see against the strings and surface of the guitar.\n",
            "155 This thing works great. I hooked it up to my ATR2100 along with a NEEWER scissor arm (without a shock mount) and I did some tests to see how my plosives were. It makes a great difference, especially since you have to get pretty close to this type of microphone (dynamic). It may be a cheap buy, but it's definitely quality and does what it needs to.\n",
            "156 Gamechanger mixer. One of the few things that has been made in this century that is decent. I use it in a studio rack that replaced a Mackie 1202VLZ, a Yamaha REV500 DSP and a Behringer 31 band DEQ2496. Was a little reluctant to replace all these devices, but over time I gave in as I learned/experimented more with this mixer. I control it with an IPAD Air 2- prefer it over Android as I can place the RTA, the EQ and the channel strip all on the same screen without having to toggle. My only small gripe is that updates and development of the IOS XAir app have not been much of a priority (2 years between 1.42 and 1.5?) . It can be a little overwhelming- after 6 months, I'm still learning more about it and that's a good thing- they'res stuff I can do with this mixer that I could not do with any analogue mixer I've had/used. Love the idea that I can take the IPAD and roam.\n",
            "157 All I can say is I'm loving it.\n",
            "158 I installed a set of these on my Epiphone G400 Pro. They offer better prevention of guitar straps slipping off than the stock strap buttons provide. These pins also have a lower profile than the stock pins. They are a single piece pin, versus strap lock that have two pieces that lock together. Installation was very easy and the provided hardware fit with no issues. These strap pins give me piece of mind and they look awesome too!\n",
            "159 This USB guitar/instrument cable lets you connect an electrical musical instrument to a PC directly through the USB port. This takes a few minutes to auto-install the drivers when you plug it in. Once installed it worked smoothly. It seems to be solidly constructed and it fits fine on both the USB plug and the guitar. Take note that it was listed on my computer as a headphone device rather than an instrument cable, so don't get confused by how it is listed in the USB devices. I would say this is worth trying if you want a USB musical instrument cable. I received a discounted sample for my honest, unbiased review.\n",
            "160 IMO this is the best and only way to mount toms, especially Pearls.  My Session kit came with them and with the heavy 6 play maple toms have never had a single issue with tuning, bouncing, lug stress whatsoever.  I think after you use them for a while you can take them for granted and don't fully understand how sturdy they are until you use another suspension system.  I recently purchased a Pearl Birch Vision kit for my wife which came with Pearl's I.S.S. mounting system.  To be fair I've never used them, and in the case of the new kit they came right off, and the Optimounts went right on.  Even though these are not the aluminum (more expensive and slightly lighter) Masterworks version, I feel they not only work for what they're intended, but they also accent the drum shells without being intrusive.  Most drummers buy, skin, and play for sound, but showing off your nice wood shells never hurts.  I can't think of a single negative, except that they're not free.  :)\n",
            "161 I'm going to give this a five stars.  It may feel fragile or not strong enough ones you open the mail, but it's a very good product and feels strong, ones you install it.  That's also easy to do.  Check out the pictures I posted. I'm happy\n",
            "162 This stuff cleaned up and made my Gibson songwriter shine like new.  Thank you very much,  Chris\n",

            "164 Hey hey\n",
            "165 Quality of sound is good. My only problem is bottom part of the amp is peeling off like in the picture in about 2 years. I never took the amp outside nor put it on the floor. Always kept in my room on the amp stand. Also I'm not a heavy user of the amp I just practice once a week or so.\n",
            "166 I love this guitar! I honestly never held a Squire brand strat before, but compared to everything I've held, played, and heard in the past; this guitar really gives you the best bang for your buck. Especially if you're like me and pretty much poor as dirt. I thought that with this guitar being so cheap I'd probably want to get some small upgrades, but I'm pretty content with what I got after the first 10 minutes of playing.\n",
            "167 Very sturdy and professional boom arm. Worth the money and definitely built to last.\n",
            "168 These SKRIMS are a little bit pricy but they are simply awesome, a friends band borrowed mine to impress a club owner, They will be buying these soon. They have a hook at the top that slips around the tightening screw on your speakers and with a par Can light underneath these are simply put.. Impressive!!!\n",

All mine are gorgeous, and with a tweak or two, bridge tweak, neck twea k, string height tweak, I am still in shock that a vintage , large headstock, 50's style Strat...the look, finish, and playability are rare in discounted axes! Hey, each and every piece screams FENDER. My studio wall is very, pinkies up! ...classy,  so much, for so little!\n",
            "171 I like Tascam products. I have a rack mounted digital recorder, a CD player and a small digital recorder. The 100mkII is also a very good recorder but I have some complaints: The battery life is short maybe because it uses only 2 cells. The volume control is very close to the phone jack making adjustment a bit dificult. The door of the AA cells seems the door of a cheap toy; it could be more robust. Apart from these minor details I'm well satisfied with the product.\n",
            "172 These wall hangers are superb. I don't understand why others of inferior quality cots twice as much. These are made out of solid wood (looks like Pinewood) glazed over with weather protective urethane. The great thing about this is that it supports all sizes of guitars, from small Ukuleles to full size. That is due to the rubber rings which they include to avoid smaller necks falling out. Another very nice thing is that the arm is screwed into a wood nut, which makes it super secured while allowing for movement in case you have odd neck shapes (like fender strats) which require a little angle.\n",
            "173 Purchased the 5-hole pickguard in eggshell for my MIM Baja Telecaster. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much since I hated the cheap, white plastic version that came stock. Black Bakelite looked good, gold anodized aluminum looked better, but somehow this one just seems right. It's a heavy, vintage thickness, rigid, and very high quality. The eggshell color adds just enough warmth as well. There is no shielding so you may want to slap some copper foil on the back.\n",
            "174 Perfect Fit!! Color match is very close.  Great product!! Added pickguard to a Les Paul Studio Deluxe..\n",
            "175 Good quality for a fair price, but it does indeed sag with heavier weight needs support. I placed 2x20# on the shelf and it sagged about 1/4. Overall a good product. If tasked with supporting small weights, it will likely be a perfect choice.\n",
            "176 The kit shipped the following day from the distributor after my placing the order, arriving ahead of schedule. It took me a couple of hours to set it up and position the components to my liking. Adjusting the sounds, tones and volume of each device was rather straightforward. For the price, I am pleasantly surprised with the action of the cymbals and pads. Sounds great when recording as well. I highly recommend this kit for someone who doesn't want to spend a fortune, but would like a functional, professional-sounding electronic drum set that can take a beating and not take up a whole lot of space. I drum left-handed and placed everything accordingly. High-five to Acorn.\n",

            "179 This is a good stand for the price. However, the mandolin seems to sit on the floor and this supports it.  Its good that it's on a rug, but I wouldn't place this on hardwood directly if you are worried about the finish of you instrument.\n",

            "181 I needed an inexpensive set of tuners for a low budget bass project and these fit.  While the lower quality does exhibit itself during tuning, they do work.  As long as one doesn't expect quality at this price point, they do the job.  I've had them mounted on the bass for about a month now, and they don't hold the tune as well as Hipshot, Grover, or other quality tuners, but I am happy with the performance at this price.\n",
            "182 I've had this tuner for about 4 years and it's been great. It tunes fine. For a long time the tuner just sat in my room, but recently I started taking the tuner around to practice and transporting it in my bag. Unfortunately one of the 3 plastic pieces where the gooseneck attaches to the tuner broke off. It still works but the head sometimes falls off of the tuner. Now I'm looking for a clip on tuner that is a little more durable. If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know.\n",
            "183 I'm using several of these on a wall I built. The hangers work great with several different head-stock shapes. I wish there were available bands, straps or locking devices to keep instruments secure here in earthquake prone California. I ended up using velcro strips under the hangers that affix over the fretboard. Otherwise a great hanger..\n",
            "184 Perfect for my EC-1000S EMG. Been using D'addario for years and they never disappoint me. Even on a shorter scale guitar there is enough tension to keep them tight.\n",
            "185 The normal adapters to be able to mount an Apogee MiC onto a regular microphone stand are about $20 for a made-for-the-purpose one or about $10 for a camera adapter which can be made to work (kind of ugly looking though, in my opinion).  What I did was to buy this adapter for less than $2 and then I ground off flush the screw stem on it.  I then used a small 1/8\" drill bit to drill a hole large enough to allow the Apogee's OEM tripod's screw to be able to attach this adapter to the swivel adapter part of the factory Apogee tripod.  Sounds complicated but it was super easy to do, works great and saved some money.\n",
            "186 For the money they aren't bad but that doesn't mean they are good. Loud highs and lows get fuzzy and the over all doesn't sound great but for a small gig band or a backup Mics these are great! The only prob I have with them is that the mic mount doesn't fit on like any mic stand I have AND BUY A CHEEP POP FILTER FOR THIS MIC OR YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!!\n",
            "187 Are use this to hang my electric guitar on the wall and it was super easy install it looks great and Im super happy with the purchase.\n",
            "188 I'm actually impressed by this mic.  For the price, assuming yours works out of the box, you can't really go wrong.  I bought two for podcasting and plug them directly into my mixer and the sound quality is excellent.  They seem well made (time will tell) and, again, the price was excellent.  Heck, they even look good.  :)\n",
            "189 Love it. Great product. Does exactly what I want it to do. Hold up my guitar!!  Sturdy construction. No complaints. I love it!\n",

            "191 You shouldn't have to buy RPS to get strings you can bend.... I have been using Ernie Ball Super Slinkies since the 1980s. I love the feel and sound they produce. but I'm done. I have seen too many .09, .10 .11 and .13 strings slip and let go lately. Could it be that it is impossible or too expensive to make them with quality US-made steel?\n",
            "192 Dont waste your money. Worst clip on tuner I have ever owned. I purchased this to use on a 2nd acoustic guitar. It is very difficult to get the guitar in tune with this tuner. It hunts all over the place looking for the proper note.\n",

            "194 When we lent (and never got back) the clips that came with our&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Behringer-C-2/dp/B000CZ0RLU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Behringer C-2</a>&nbsp;mics, a pair of these clips were the perfect replacements.  The jaws are lined with a grippy foam that hugs the lipstick-sized C-2s but also caresses the tapering ice cream cone body of, say, a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Shure-SM58/dp/B000CZ0R42/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Shure SM58</a>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Samson-R21/dp/B000IJ9GU8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Samson R21</a>.  They're compact enough to fit the case that comes with the Behringer mics and priced for the musician on a budget.\n",
            "195 This dampener works OK, but man it is really clumsy and obtrusive. When it's in the up position you can poke someone's eye out. You're better off learning to use the palm of your hand at the bridge of your guitar to dampen or muffle the sound or try tying a \"hanky\" (handkerchief) at the top of the neck.\n",
            "196 I'm more happy with this purchase than anything I've bought recently.  It's just great.  It's simple, sturdy, well-built, and it holds my dreadnought guitar perfectly.  No room for improvement that I can find in this product.\n",
            "197 These are excellent clamps! I have no idea where the poor ratings below are coming from, for 35mm diameter truss tubing like the TRUSST systems (or any 35mm or 1-3/8\" OD tubing ) these clamps fit like a glove, clamp tightly, have beautiful surface finish that won't scratch, flawless bolt and wingnut hardware, and work perfectly. Will also clamp securely to 1-1/4\" OD tubing. The roll pins that secure the two halves and the toggle bolt are all firmly and properly fitted as well. I got 5 to try since they were such a great price and after receiving them went back for 10 more. These will not work on 1-1/2\" or 1\" or even 1-1/8\" tubing, get the other models for that, measure your tubing! These are also great for putting a light on top of a speaker tripod stand, most of which have a 1-3/8\" tube on top, add the clamp and bolt on your light.\n",
            "198 This was an easy installation. Used it on a recent tele build. Fits right in with hand pressure. Used some light taps with a rubber mallet to seat a few that weren't exactly flush.\n",
            "199 Excellent  fader for my Pioneer DJM-850 Mixer. Make sure sure you go to the Innofader website to and check their listing for the specific replacement for your mixer. Easy Install.\n",
            "200 I so love the simplicity and ease of usage of this AxeRig Tuner!\n",
            "201 This is my 2nd Donner DP-1. The first was purchased to replace a noisy daisy-chain supply. Ran 8 effects, including the Line 6 DL4 (with the reverse polarity adapter) without any noise, power interruptions, or channel failures. From what I understand (after a lot of reading/research), these seem to be independent channels, but share a common ground. I'm not an electrician, but I do know that whether I'm running through my amp at home, or through the PA at church, I'm getting zero noise. Quite content with these.\n",
            "202 These knobs are exactly what I needed for the finishing touch on my Fender Jaguar Bass.\n",
            "203 I never knew this thing existed. I'm so glad I found this as I was always using a regular capo and placing it on just the 5 strings but the grip and placement was awkward and didn't provide a confident grip. Using this allows good grip. I use this a lot to practice my finger-picking songs...gotta love that low E, open string, bass note. Thank you Planet Waves for making this and in a simplistic yet convenient form.\n",
            "204 These are amazing! Not just for the price, they are just really great pickups. I rapped mine with friction tape over copper foil tape to fight against cheap wiring in my home.\n",
            "205 Works great. Improves audio greatly on the BMPCC. So versatile. I can rig it to a camera plug in an external Mic or use it all by itself as a recorder. Not to fond of the thin plastic makes it feel like a cheap toy but it's lightweight and works great.\n",
            "206 I bought a used MIM strat that came with a black pick guard and creamish colored pickups. The guitar was great but the pick guard wasn't my style. I put this on and now I love the look of this guitar. Highly recommend.\n",
            "207 They're pretty decent panels for what it's worth. By far they're not professional grade, but I think they can do well for a small home studio. They are fairly thin, so initially it's going to absorb higher frequencies better than lower frequencies, so keep that in mind.\n",
            "208 Well...it plays perfectly, but the once clear, white on blue lettering rubs right off. Body's natural oils... rub whatever paint they use. I'm considering buying a perm marker in a bright color and drawing them on again. Yes, the gold side is embossed, so it won't rub off, but it's the blue on white that a person looks to for quickly identifying notes. Long-term, it's more about the pitches being stable/etc., but I'm disappointed that only after three uses, the lettering is rubbing off. Put a better finish on these things...coat it with something non-toxic, but non-reactive with oils/acids from people's fingers since that's what we'll be using when we hold the things. Other than storage at home, the soft pouch is useless.\n",
            "209 The metal G is wound and wrapped in plastic to keep it separate.  Great sound, but admittedly I haven't tried any other brand.\n",
            "210 The picture doesn't do this bridge justice, I was skeptical of the quality when I ordered this Tremolo bridge but was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. I wasn't so concerned with the quality because I planed on using it on an old broken down imported Kramer ST300 that I refinished. I gave it a 3 because of the screws it takes a lot of hand strength to get the screws seated. You have to be very careful that you don't strip the philip screw heads the screw driver doesn't quit fit the number 2. I'll take the guitar to my shared work shop to see if a larger screw driver fits better.\n",
            "211 See my review of the Art Pro VLA II which includes  the 355, both Great !\n",
            "212 Check out my photo. After a bit of time, this thing moved and shifted and left sticky un-removable glue all over the head.  Yuk! I did not have this problem with a regular bass drum head.\n",
            "213 This pedal works fine until it breaks, but they WILL break with any kind of moderate use.  The bottom portion is two pieces, and after a little time the plastic which connects the \"pedal\" to the \"frame\" breaks.  It's done it the same way in all of the ones I have.  I've been through about 4 of these in the last 3 years at my church, with two keyboard players using them each week on two separate instruments.  Each of the two keyboards/sustain pedals get used once per week, for about 20 minutes.  I don't think this is enough use to break so consistently.  Our work-around is something firm like a piece of floor tiling on the bottom and a whole lot of duct tape.\n",
            "214 I have been using these straps for at least six years. I have never had them fail once. The tweed material is strong, durable and gets softer the longer you use it. I always attach Dunlop strap locks to my guitars and knowing the metal link in the strap is a great added protection as opposed to the plastic which can break.\n",
            "215 My oldest son plays and owns many guitars. He asked for a new guitar strap for Christmas. I ordered this one because we are Irish and I thought it looked really cool.\n",
            "216 I really love playing this guitar. Every since I received it, it has been by my side. Full sized neck. Sustain is fantastic. It stays in tune even with new strings. Fits perfectly in my suitcase. Will be taking it on all my vacations. I added the foam to the lap rest for a little more comfort while sitting on my lap. Plus, to prevent it from sliding when sitting. If you want a great travel guitar or even a guitar to play around the house, this is the one to get.\n",
            "217 I could not imagine this product was so small but so powerful at the same time. I am using it in my analog mastering room, as a media reader. Especially interesting for the bluetooth connectivity. Connecting the output to one input of a Samson C Control studio controller, and there you go... send the sound wherever you want to direct it in the studio.\n",
            "218 Arrived 3 days after I ordered it, the bent welding should've clued me to what would happen. 2nd time I tuned it the inferior quality tension bolts started stripping, making the macho (small drum) useless. Mostly good materials (oak, steel, rawhide) + terrible craftmanship = drum being returned. Lay down another $30 and get some Aspires, I've gotten 2 sets of those (1 for me, 1 as a gift) and they won't let you down, or you might want to check out similarly priced bongos from Meinl, Gon Bops or Tycoon, but avoid this hunk a junk.\n",
            "219 I bought It to storage my Epiphone Les Paul Standard, It fits perfect, the inside is soft, this case provides a great protection, It's a little heavy, but I think this is the best choice for a epi LP.\n",
            "220 First of all the weight of the keys is absolutely perfect. Second I was hoping that the settings when you play softly or stabbed the keys where almost as accurate as a real grand piano. This is amazing. If you play softly, hitting the keys like a feather, it delivers the signal to the daw flawlessly. I was on a budget when I bought this, I was contemplating waiting for a more expensive one but needed it asap for a project. I'm very happy with this!\n",
            "221 When you buy aftermarket pickup rings, lining up the mounting holes is a concern... however, these lined up perfectly with the holes on my Dean Schenker V.  They are for a flat-top guitar, so if you try to mount them on a Les Paul, which is arched, you'll have problems.  Make sure the pickup rings you order are for the right type of top.\n",
            "222 Good fit on my Epiphone Les Paul.\n",
            "223 You really cant beat it for the price, however, I would not use it for really heavy lights. Its only rated for 50lbs anyway. If you have some LED fixtures, a couple lasers (attached picture).... then this is perfect. Heavy scanners, and other large format lights (even if only using one ~40 lbs) I would not use. It only feels secure enough for a couple smaller lights and a fogger. Just buy it!!! You could always use it in your entertainment center and or, mobile DJ rig for some sort of light application.\n",
            "224 For the money, it is awesome.  I upgraded the transmitter cord, and it cured some of the cable noise. (The one included is a bit long and cheap).  It has a clear sound and good battery life. Plus, the receiver is small enough to fit on my pedal board.\n",
            "225 I love this thing its so convenient to use at my desk! It's sturdy enough for my all metal, b1 conderser mic! I wouldn't use any heavier of a mic though. The shock mount s decent to!! The arm has a decent enough reach for my big desk! Zero complaints.\n",
            "226 Phat,PHILTHY AND JUST PLAIN ON ALL THE TIME!,Grinderthru the THUNDERVERB!\n",
            "227 On the day these picks arrived I went to a gig and put one in my pocket while I set up my gear.  Maybe twenty minutes later, I took the pick out of my pocket and found it had already shed the cork \"grip\".\n",
            "228 My stand came in and it was larger than I expected!! However, I like its features. It can expand to 4 different wide settings. It's perfect and very strong for my bass. Thanks!\n",
            "229 We use these for everything from our acoustic bass down to our ukuleles. I know there is a smaller model available for ukes, violins, etc.; we haven't yet ordered those, but these will work on smaller instruments if one doesn't extend the feet to their maximum width. They're gentle on the instruments, and the grippy material keeps them secure.\n",
            "230 I've been carrying mine around for about ten years, using it as it was designed: easy carry so you can sing \"Kumbaya\" with the gang around the camp fire without disturbing the neighbors.  It has seen a lot of smoke and a lot of salt spray at the beach.  It is NOT a full guitar so don't expect it to act, feel, play, look or sound like one.  It is NOT a beginners' guitar and I would never recommend it as such.\n",
            "231 Was skeptical after reading previous reviews. Very happy with this chair. To be used for saxophone playing. Very easy to assemble as most is already put together. The backing of the backrest and seat isn't the greatest, but will do. The backrest does clank, but a trip to the hardware store and pick up those cork round pads for cabinets, problem solved. This chair is comfortable to me and sturdy enough. I gambled and won with this chair.\n",
            "232 Great quality, good design, look expensive.\n",
            "233 Works fine. There were no instructions. Well actually there were, but they were not in English. It's pretty self explanatory though. Great deal.\n",
            "234 This is a wonderful gig bag! I've included pictures of the more popular styles of guitar so you can see how well they fit. The purple Les Paul style fits snug length wise with the extra cushion pads, and fits snug side to side. The black Stratocaster style is ALMOST to long, but still fits fine. The grey SG style is a small guitar, so there is extra room top to bottom and side to side, but with the neck strap, it doesn't slide around too much, and I would still feel comfortable using this bag with the SG. The padding is aproximently an inch think all around and top and bottom, and the zippers are of good quality.\n",
            "235 I own a Yamaha 61 keys Keyboard and I ordered this stand because the product description says it is Yamaha make. But what is written on the box is:'Keyboard Stand For Portable Keyboards from Yamaha and Others' and there is no Yamaha emblem neither on the box nor on the stand. In fact, it is just a Chinese make generic stand. Apart from that, I am happy with the stand. It is:\n",
            "236 Better thab the terrible string trees my guitar had,  had to drill a small hole though to mount as yoy can see in the pics\n",
            "237 Works Great ...was easy to Install ....Love it\n",
            "238 I bought these for my office. I wanted to put a barrier between the speaker phone and the wall to help reduce echo and keep my nosy neighbor from listening in. I can't tell if you if it works for the neighbor but the echo is gone now. I also have my computer speakers near them as well and that seems to shield a little noise too.\n",
            "239 OK I gave these tuners a 5 and I've not installed them on the Fender Strat they're intended for. Made in the USA machine heads is what I wanted for the MIUSA Strat. I'm doing a custom Strat to raise funds for my web site which is dedicated to Indie Music. I bought this guitar gutted and still need Pick-Ups and hand carved inlay. I will update when I string the guitar and play a few licks.\n",
            "240 I think the amount of positive feedback these mics are receiving should tell you something about how amazing they sound. I just simply want to say that if you purchase these mics, do yourself a huge favor and buy a 6\" gooseneck! I use my Spirits for drum overheads and apart from them sounding incredible, adding a little gooseneck makes this a perfect microphone. The internal shock absorption is actually really impressive! Amazing mics for the money! Grab you a couple!\n",
            "241 It's a tuner and a good one for the price...makes me happy. Love behringer\n",
            "242 Sadly, these strings were suggested as replacements for a Yamaha Guitalele GL-1.\n",
            "243 I really really loved these till this happened at a gig last night ( see picture)\n",
            "244 I put a 10 splash cymbal on this cymbal arm. Works great! I would suggest putting a small piece of rubber under the metal clamp. The one that comes attached is thin and doesnt protect from metal to metal contact.\n",
            "245 All I can say is wow! This has to be the best amp at this price. I chose this over the fender and I'm glad I did. It is clean-sounding smooth has a great tone nice design easily move it around even though it does weigh over 30 lb. This is a bargain I'm glad I went with this brand. The size is big enough to punch out for mid sized church functions with ease! The pic doesn't really show u the size. It's bigger than the pic puts out. No distortion just a clean bass sound... Again A bargain and I will buy a bigger one in the future!\n",
            "246 This is a good buy\n",
            "247 Highly recommend. It did wonders for my Kremona Solea. It's like a totally different guitar. Much more lively.\n",
            "248 I put a set of these on a Jag I finished up a few weeks ago and I'm thoroughly impressed.\n",
            "249 bought this to slap on a cheap p bass from e-bay. I figured if it sucks, its only a few bucks.\n",
            "250 I'm using these high hats for a small kit ,( Pearl Rhythm traveler drum set. ) and they give a good sizzle. For the price that you're paying these little guys give you a great sound. I wouldn't get these if you're planing on playing \"pro live shows\", or recording. I have a pair of zildjian titanium cymbals / high hats and you can tell the difference. These high hats don't hold / sustain their sound for too long. If you're playing rock beat or just starting off.. These are a great starter set, and for the price you can't really disagree. A must have for a start to advanced player.\n",
            "251 Just out these beauty's on my Mitchell and they are perfect. I wanted to add character to my guitar and this definitely helps.\n",
            "252 I'm pretty happy with this string action gauge. It's a sturdy piece of stainless steel with easy to read numbers and measurements etched into the steel. Definitely worth the money paid. A must have for anyone who sets up their own guitars.\n",
            "253 Great kit after leveling and crowning the frets this guitar plays great I love this kit\n",
            "254 Great look. Great product. Great buy!!!!\n",
            "255 Great picks, the best holding pick ever, more of a medium flex.\n",
            "256 These fit my Samson meteor Mic nicely. Also fits great on Zoom H2n. Snug. Good standard foam not thin like some others. Also trimmed one to put over my MSH6 Mic capsule.\n",
            "257 I settled on the Kelly Shu only after reading lots of reviews (of the Shu, May, and Gibraltar offerings). I chose the Shu because it seemed to be the most robust to physical abuse and offers varied placement options. I installed on my 16 x 16 inch Pearl Session floor tom conversion and attached an Audix D6--a rather substantial kick drum mic that is hangs pretty heavy toward the front. I got a little creative with the install, attaching all eight leather straps around the circumference of the drum and weaving the rubber cord (full length) back and forth around the Shu (see photos). I used the May no-drill vent hole mic cable adapter to wire it up. I'm very pleased with the design and quality of the Kelly Shu. Figuring out how to install it was a fun challenge--there were several options and I settled on the one that didn't require me to cut the rubber cord, just in case I change my mind.\n",
            "258 I bought this last week from another retailer. This is the best case I have ever purchased, but it's heavy as hell! I wasn't expecting it to be 150lbs empty.\n",
            "259 I've bought 2 of these as well as an instrument from this seller. The straps are very attractive and sturdy.\n",
            "260 Works great! I was happy with the length of the cables and how sturdy the jacks are. This is a great value, with good quality.\n",
            "261 Provided that this is not a Fender Telecaster but a Squier, I was pleasantly surprised by its playability and its tone. The three pick-up options make it very versatile for any type of music you may want to use it for. The difference in quality between this guitar model and the Squier by Fender Bullet Strat is incredible and well worth the $50 price increase.\n",
            "262 It fits my les paul copy that isn't exactly yhe same size as the lp but i wanted to see if it fits and it does. My epiphone is in the shop so i might as well use it for my other guitar.\n",
            "263 The naugahyde cover was lifting and the glue residue was tacky. The fit for my Tele was not as right. For my Schecter it was good.\n",
            "264 I love this strap! It's beautiful and comfy and fits great. Yes drilling into my uke was scary but there are really good videos out there that make it easy. The shoe string got in my way so I strapped it to the g string tuner. I dunno how smart that is but it's my life I can do what I want!\n",
            "265 tried something different rather than my daddario xl 10's ( nickels)...- they didn't seem as  as smooth  and  initially i thought they had too much bite  - overly bright not as balanced as the d'ad's 10 pure Nickel... BUT  after 2 days they have settled in and like all strings have  gotten some wear and sound much better!  very clear  and punchy - a tad bright for my style but  still good  im sure its perfect for many!- if they hold up for a decent spell ill adjust my review to 4 stars...they have -I did\n",
            "266 This thing works!  I use a DW 3000 Double-Pedal, and have had issues with the slave pedal sliding forward - even though it comes with it's own built-in spurs.  The DW's onboard spurs are about where the ball of the foot goes, so with the pedal jumping, even when extended all the way down, the pedal still moved (hopped?) forward.  I tried adding additional Velcro, but that didn't stop it.  But now, with the Pearl Pedal Stabilizer on the front of it, it stays put.  The Pearl's long spikes go deep into my old oriental carpet that I use as my drum rug at a perfect angle to restrict any forward movement.  Now I can really kick it hard!  Pleasantly surprised at how heavy-duty and large it is.  If your slave pedal has a hoop clamp on it, you're ready to go right out of the package.  The spikes also can be reversed with rubber tips for hard surfaces.  I don't really need that feature as my rug goes with me to gigs.\n",
            "267 Time will tell how it holds up...\n",
            "268 Poorly manufactured.  The plastic cushion top was only halfway attached.  See photo.\n",
            "269 It's definitely tiny. They weren't kidding about that. That being said, the screen is 1\"X1\", but pretty bright and easy to read. The colors are rich, which helps. I play 6, 7, and 8 string guitars and was able to tune all 3 with no problems. Quick detection, and accurate. Even the F# on the 8 string was picked up almost instantly.\n",
            "270 Awesome stand!\n",
            "271 This plate comes with a cheap, worthless jack installed in it. I was planning on throwing it away and installing a Switchcraft 11 jack in it instead. The mounting hole diameter was 9.5 mm, and the Switchcraft uses a 3/8\" mounting hole, so I needed to use a 3/8\" drill bit to widen the hole just slightly. 9.5 mm is .374 inches, so it is only one thousandth of an inch different, but did need to be expanded nevertheless. It also only came with 2 screws instead of the 4 needed. I had the four screws that came with the guitar anyway, from the plastic jack plate I was replacing, so that was no problem either. The screws were a bit bigger than the intended screws so it gave it a bit more of an industrial look that was unintentional but I think it looks good nonetheless. It was a little bigger than the old jack plate as well so I had to bondo in the screw holes and drill others out, but that's pretty much par for the course with aftermarket modifications of any sort.\n",
            "272 Simple, cost effective, no frills design that gets the job done. Hardly worth noting, but there are no mounting instructions. It should be intuitive, however.\n",
            "273 These are very sturdy and useful. I have one for gigs, one for busking, and a backup. I prefer hanging my violin on a stand than laying it in my case. It feels more secure and I have quick access.\n",
            "274 Worked great... for about 9 months. Then poof. Its dead. Fuse is fine (double checked with meter), was plugged into a power conditioner/surge protector. It just stopped working. No power at all. Learned my lesson, Behringer products just don't last.\n",
            "275 I love these great finish and quality\n",
            "276 This amp is the real deal.  Great crunch and gain tones and with some tweaking, not half bad clean\"ish\" tones.  I've played this through the two 8\" Orange cabs (had to get those too as they were just TOO cool ((and cute)) and not crazy money) and the sound is very pleasing and revealing for a practice amp.  I primarily play it through my Blackstar stack that I've fitted with Celestion V30s... Wow...there it is~!!!  You would never know this thing was such a tone monster... Even with just a few knobs it's easy to get lost for hours playing this thing.  My favorite match is with my Chapman ML-1 Hotrod...which only has a volume \"tone\" control (EVH fans get this).  Not a lot of mucking around with too many knobs or too many options on either the guitar or this amp... Just tone up and go.  I see the Micro Dark just came out...that's probably next~!  Higher gain, buffered effects loop and speaker emu at the headphone out for recording direct (if that's your thing).\n",
            "277 I purchased an old Yamaha E112C electric guitar that needed to be completely redone and I decided that I would replace the original chrome parts with Gold and the strap pegs look great. You can't see the strap pegs in the picture you do see the color and how the gold parts look.\n",
            "278 Fit my Epiphone Les Paul 100 perfectly.  Swapped out factory cream colored trim for these and they look great. Posting before and after pics\n",

            "280 Brass Tacks: is this the greatest mic in the world? No. But on a budget this mic is AMAZING. The lows and highs sound great and the mids sound well fleshed out. If you are looking for s nice rich sound, this is it.\n",
            "281 I installed these Grovers to my LTD and it went smooth as can be! Absolutly no problems. The strings I installed were new and held their tune far better than than new strings without the locking feature. I was a bit nervous because these do not have a button type to secure the strings. Grover has another mechanisim to lock the strings in place. It works great! Just make sure you hear the click! Its not loud so you may want to install these in a quiet place. Read the directions carefully and your all set. I put a set of the same Grovers on my cheapy Johnson hollowbody. Perfect fit!\n",
            "282 they sound good i found that the wiring is off but can be sequenced properly using this diagram colors are different but sequence is the same top left is hot, bottom left goes with ground/bare, two on right are together or can be used for tap\n",
            "283 I chose this cable b/c it was supposed to have the more durable metallic interfaces and superior strain relief as pictured. What showed up is nothing more than some cheap and flimsy cable that can be bought for a lot less elsewhere. I feel cheated.\n",
            "284 Freakin' sweet y'all!\n",
            "285 I had fun putting the kit together. I made a simple customization by adding two WWII  vintage decals (from etsy). Like most other builders, I swapped strings. I also re-arranged a few steps in the instructions. I will try to add photos showing the decals. (At the moment I do not see how to add photos).\n",
            "286 I  hooked up the light to a karaoke and mixer board very happy and pleased with her performance .  Lights are controlled by a DMX  DJ  Operating board .\n",
            "287 Go up 1 size. My hands are not large for my size and they are certainly not thick. I wear a size medium glove comfortably and large is almost always too big. Yet a size medium in these barely squeezes onto my pinky. Sizing is not close to accurate. Even used a heat gun to expand the opening slightly, no go. Just makes them wider bUT thinner. Disappointed\n",
            "288 This stand is great. Its light weight and sturdy base when extended to 9ft. It has screws for 8 lights so you can fit any size light on the T-bar. I have an Eliminator Lighting Katana LED, on one side and it takes up about 3 of the screw locations. You can fit a single projector light on this stand if you remove the T-Bar. Pictures show a close up of the screw that hold the t-bar/projector light.\n",
            "289 I used this on a custom bass build and it worked great!\n",
            "290 This stand is very portable and compact, but I no longer have confidence in it's ability to keep my electric basses safe. My vintage Fender Jazz Bass would not fit correctly due to the offset body shape and a few years ago it fell over causing significant damage to the headstock (see picture). After this, I resigned to use this stand only with my Fender Precision Bass which has a more symmetrical body shape, but even this bass has come close to falling over if not placed just so. I've decided to go back to the more traditional type of guitar stand for my instruments.\n",
            "291 A great product, which made a wonderful under-bed light in our application.\n",
            "292 I upgraded the bass and tom tom heads on my Pearl Rhythm Traveler kit (ASIN: B0002FO4R8) to these heads with amazing results. Before upgrading the open bottom toms had a lot of ring and were impossible to get the tone I wanted no matter how carefully I tuned them. I replaced the heads with these and was rewarded with an amazing difference in sound quality. The ringing, hollow quality I previously struggled to correct is now a nice \"thump\" sound that works perfectly with jazz and rock.\n",
            "293 great little stand , good price and fast prime shipping make this a good deal and value...i got it paired along with a ChromaCast small bench stool also folding...only down side was that the stand was missing one of the rubber end caps for the top crosspiece, so my keyboard is a little tippy and unstable....i'm trying to figure out how to get only the missing end cap piece and not have to return the whole stand,and wait for a replacement.\n",
            "294 Not real happy with this but then I wanted to save some money.  Not a very good decision on my part.  Should have shelled out the $30-35 for an actual Fender or Fender licensed pickguard so I'll eat this.  But I'm posting so YOU don't have to make my mistake.  Not knocking the company either, they tried but just didn't get it right.  See the pics.\n",
            "295 Needed something cheap but that worked for the bedroom. My main gear is upstairs in my studio but I often practice in my bedroom. I run a little Fender Champ combo in there and wanted some dirty tones for classic rock, blues and some heavier rock. This did the trick. Made of plastic but seems durable enough for my needs. Get some really cool tones out of this pedal. Can dial in almost any blues or rock tone I want. Was impressed by it for such a low cost pedal. For the money it was a very good choice.\n",
            "296 GREAT FIXTURE\n",
            "297 I loved this guitar stand at first b/c it held my Guild & Martin acoustics securely. After about a year of stationary use, the plastic housing which was responsible for holding up the neck support cracked and cannot be repaired (see pics). Since I'm past any warranty period, I'm stuck.\n",
            "298 This guitar is an amazing value!!! USA pups, chunky neck, and a fast fretboard (very round radius!) Its the kind of guitar you never want to put down. Switching options make it very versatile. My only criticism is the poly blonde finish is very plastic looking. Thankfully the grain is showing through more and more every day. I leave mine in the sun and may repaint in the future.\n",
            "299 Poor design doesn't line their own pedals up when connected using these. The offset isn't enough and results in each pedal along the line mounted a bit lower than the one next to it. As you can see in the picture, the third pedal from the chain is already almost off the board. How can they overlook this?\n",

            "303 Excellent, clear, punchy, great note definition. 60s rock, 70s R&B, modern jazz, this set covers it all. I build custom guitars and basses, have tried many different types and brands. These are my go to pickups. To be honest, I was a bit surprised at how articulate these are, as the SD quarter pound p-bass pickups are somewhat dark.\n",
            "304 I'd been searching for a while, to find a reverb pedal that would be able to fill the shoes of the built-ins that I'd used in the 60's and 70's... and here it is. Due to the unheard of low price, I half expected to get a \"half fast\" performance from this pedal, but fortunately, this was not the case. Upon plugging in the unit, and testing it with my Les Paul guitar, and my practice amp, I was amazed to hear how well this inexpensive pedal was able to replicate those old-school tones. This included emulation of multiple reverb types, such as  \"spring\", \"plate\", \"hall\", \"gate\", \"room\", and a really cool new one called \"modulate\" that throws a hint of chorus into it. Behringer not only got my money, but my respect and gratitude.\n",
            "305 This tailpiece is very solid and the plating and finish couldn't be better. So great for the price. I don't expect plating will stand contact/rubbing for long, but that's the case with most gold plated hardware, so I suggest any gold hardware be handled delicately. I know gold plating costs so much more than its price, so it's a bargain.\n",
            "306 Lets just start off by examining the price. At under twenty dollars you won't find many competitors, especially with this build quality. It is essentially an embroidery hoop with black pantyhose, an adjustable arm and screw clamp. Building one yourself will probably run you over twenty dollars and you will end up with an interesting mixture of distracting textures and colors, so why not just buy it instead? Functionally it works fine. It does muffle sound to some extent when stacked up against a metal mesh screen but for anything short of an audience of 50,000, it should appease just fine. all in all, if you are hitting annoying pops in your recording and don't want to spend a lot of money -- this is the way to go.\n",
            "307 For practical purposes, these patches are thin (which I like) and clear (if you get the clear ones).  They are not hard \"plasticky\" (yes, I made up a new word...remember you heard it here first) but have a snug, comfortable feel under the teeth. I use them on my OBrien crystal and Richard Hawkins Model G mouthpieces and they look great.  Now, the best thing about them for me personally is the R....my name is Robert.  Hah.  Looks like I have custom mouthpiece patches. ;-)\n",
            "308 I am 61 years old,been playing since 14. I have bought 4 or 5 Crescents over the years and have not found a lemon yet. These are great guitars!!!!!! I left the strings that came with it on,and after they quit stretching(like any set of strings will do)it stays perfectly tuned. I will be buying more to start a good collection and would highly recommend this to a friend. It is a keeper for sure!!\n",
            "309 In theory this is a great pedal but they are notorious for having problems freezing up. Mine is basically a paper weight right now. It has to go to a service center to be reset. From everything I've read on forums, odds are that it will probably freeze up again after being repaired. Hopefully not but I'm not feeling very optimistic. When / if TC gets the software to be more stable then this would be a fantastic product but until that happens I can't recommend it.\n",
            "310 It does what it's supposed to do, and does it well. A medium Fender pick measures .72 thick on my digital caliper. An Amazon gift card is the same and my expired driver license is ..78. My credit card is. 78. Expired cards will keep you in picks for a long time! The attached pic shows you can get 5 picks from a standard size card.\n",
            "311 The Pedaltrain is a bit pricey, but it keeps everything well organized and I have room for a few more pedals. I don't gig, but the board is solid and light, and the soft case seems sturdy enough for someone who will travel with their pedals. I purchased industrial strength velcro to mount my pedals, and i mounted my Donner power supply to the bottom of the board using velcro with no issues. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase, and my wife is happy that the area in front of my amp is no longer a rat's nest of cables and daisy chained pedals.\n",
            "312 This was a direct replacement for the black plastic tip on my lp studio. Works fine, looks great. No issues going on a year!\n",
            "313 Excellent microphone. No background noise, great clarity, great low end but a bit crunched on the high end.\n",

            "315 I bought a pair of these just over a year ago, at first they worked just fine then I started getting static when adjusting the Volume control to the point where the Main speaker was not playing but the other one was. Having bought then outside of the US it was very difficult to get the warranty honored so I decided to fix them myself as I am a technician. What I discovered was the volume controller which is also the Power switch was defective, and I could not get a replacement. so what I did was replace the volume control with another one and and added a power switch. Now it works like a charm.\n",
            "316 Hey actually this wasn't what I expected. I expected a cheap case. This is a well made sturdy case for a great price. It did smell horrible lol. But it also came with rack screws AND washers.\n",
            "317 It works, for the price, for what it is. I needed a gig bag, at about 25 dollars in a hurry, for carrying my carry around bass around town- in/ out car, hanging out at coffee shops, walking around place to place. If I had about 50 dollars I would have bought the next model up, the G4 or whatever, with more padding, but I didn't, and this one is doing the job just fine. I have a Precision Bass copy (an Epiphone Accu-Bass, hence the weird headstock) , and it fits in the bag.  The bag is protective enough and seems durable enough for the purpose of carrying the bass around town. The pocket won't hold much- just strings and some music, but the bag does carry the bass.\n",
            "318 Love the sound. Usually get controlled sound emperor. Nice change up.\n",
            "319 This is very light yet very durable and protective. I have a Squier Strat and it fits perfectly. It won't fit the guitar with the strap on, but I never do that anyways. The pockets are big as well as the inside compartments. Enough room for a few pedels inside or a strap, cord, picks and other small accessories.\n",
            "320 I bought two kits for a total of six guitar stand/holders. I don't know why they're described as \"Acoustic\" holders, I'm them using them to hold a heavy Fender Precision bass, and other standard electric guitars. They're easy to install, but as others have written, do not use the fasteners that come in the kit. They are cheaply made and are unsafe. I simply stopped by Walmart and picked up a couple packs of self-drilling drywall anchors (pictured). They're inexpensive fasteners and helped make the installation a breeze. I was able to install all six guitar stands in about 30 minutes.\n",

            "326 I've tried several other \"cheaper\" tuners and this is the one that is highly accurate. I even had them all connected at once and this one got the most precise readings. It's good for 6 string guitars but 7-8 strings may have more problems. The design is nice and the color is beautiful. It feels quite fragile since it's plastic so you have to be careful with it but it's cheap enough to replace without worry. Nice to have if you don't have a line in through tuner like the Korg pitch black.\n",
            "327 Hot damn!  I replaced the original neck position humbucker on my 1980 Les Paul (which I bought new) with a SPH90 Phat Cat.  What a difference!!  It is MUCH louder, and brighter, and all around sweeter and more tuneful that the original.  I used to rarely use the neck pickup alone.  Now I'll use it almost exclusively (though mixing in a bit of the bridge humbucker is sweet too).  I'm very glad I bought this and made the switch.  P.S. - I've had no problem with hum from this pickup - if you do, your problem is probably somewhere in your amp.\n",
            "328 The quality of the case is all metal\n",
            "329 It was exactly as I expected. Sounds great under all circumstances! Hot sound, without being harsh. Serious attitude. Serious attack. Sounds great clean also. All of this, without losing the guitar's natural voice. Installed it in a '78 Stratocaster, and gave it a new life. It's just too bad that it took me decades to finally take the plunge to switch from a Super D. (which had been my go to in all my guitars since the mid 80s).\n",
            "330 My application of this is to plug three guitars in to my pedalboard (see pics).  It is noiseless, and shows no tone-sucking qualities at all.  It runs well off a 9-volt or a Dunlop DC Brick, although that is just for the function of the lights.  It also works with no power at all (but the lights come in handy to know which selection is ON).\n",
            "331 A solid strap that I used on my Strat.  Very nice.  It's not flashy, which fits my style well.  Works well, solidly made.  No worries that the guitar is going to come off while playing.  I've taken some shots of the Poly Locks, check out the mechanism.  It's pretty nice.  Definitely will do what you want and last a good long while.\n",
            "332 This kick-pad is excellent. It additionally lowers the sound of your bass drum, so if you're not satisfied with the sound, this will help. It lasts very long and can take a beating of all kinds, whether you single pedal like Nirvana of double pedal like All That Remains. I highly suggest this kick-pad if you're looking for one that will last long and protect your bass drum from injury  =D\n",
            "333 It takes awhile to get used to using leather instead of the usual fabric strap. Fabric strap can be shifted freely on my shoulder however leather one has lots of friction and it has thicker width. I need to lift up the strap to adjust its position on my shoulder. This is made of synthetic\n",

            "339 A lot of the reviews for this are divided. \"Oh, it sounds great,\" and \"sounds like a s***ty gong\" come to mind. I bought it anyways. It is definitely a cheap buy, and still looks like an amazing cymbal. As for sound, it does sound pretty crappy. But it's still a great buy for beginner drummers, or drummer who just like to jam out in their basements/garage. Once you start to get a gig or two, you should consider going with a better cymbal\n",
            "340 I've been using these windscreens for years on all kinds of mics, and so has the entertainment industry. They block out wind noise and plosives without affecting the sound of the mic, not to mention the square shape is more visually-appealing to use on a mic like a Beta 87C than a ball-shaped windscreen. Speaking of ball-shaped mics, you can even get these to work on those. The proof is as easy to find as turning on your TV in the morning--under the A85WS on Wayne Brady and Jonathan Mangum's mics on \"Let's Make A Deal\" is a Beta 58A cartridge.\n",
            "341 Very happy with this baritone ukulele. I have been wanting to try one since I also play guitar. There was a little buzzing but raising the bridge a tiny bit solved the problem.

            "342 I love D'Addario strings, however, this particular set when installed on my 28.625\" scale 8-string - the top .74 string was not wound far enough to reach the nut. This left me with roughly 1/3\" of the string that does not match (Pic). I'm honestly not sure if this is an isolated incident or if all packs will yield the same result. I will give them another try in hopes of a better set, but if this is the standard then D'Addario should really consider the extended scale of 8-string guitars and ensure the strings are wound far enough.\n",

            "355 This Gator guitar hanger is sturdy, attractive, and easy to install.  It comes with wall anchors for drywall, and long screws.  The hangers are rubber coated to prevent finish damage.  The instructions are simple and I had this installed in under 5 minutes.  There are no screws visible once the unit is on the wall.  I was initially worried that the guitar would hang too close to the wall, however it is a good 3.5\" away.  It did take some \"oomph\" to get the actual hanger prongs parallel to the floor, but it certainly feels solidly locked in.  I was fortunate enough to have a location where a stud was available (and I would highly recommend using a stud for the install), however 2 heavy duty screw-in wall anchors also come with the unit for drywall mounting.  I much prefer this clean look to having the guitar on a floor stand in the corner where it tends to gather dust and dog hair. Ugh.\n",

I ordered one that had been returned so it was sold as used, it was sent through the APO mail system (which I really appreciate with Amazon), but could not find a mark or smudge on it.  It was as new as it could be. Much to my surprise, it was also \"IN TUNE\". It was setup perfectly.

            "373 Sweet upgrade to my Stratocaster. My mexican strat came with a blank chrome plate and went ahead and gave it this little upgrade. Gave it a nice touch.. Highly recommend it\n",
            "374 Product is very good quality, it very give the good signal, I am recommend this product to anyone who looking for. .\n",
            "375 Bought two of these at the same time and one arrived broken in two spots. The adjustment screw was missing on the base (see photo) and the one for the top part was stripped out.  Both screws are made of plastic with some kind of cheap pot metal fittings that likely don't take much force to break.\n",
            "376 Very nice case. Fits my stratocaster just fine. It feels good knowing I can store my guitar properly, instead of leaning it against the wall.\n",
            "377 Garbage. Plastic strap adjuster has broken! From gentle studio use only!!! Very, very flimsy. You get what you pay for...I just have way too many guitars and needed an extra strap. I've already cannibalized this strap for the pad. so it's a keeper now. STAY AWAY FROM THIS P.O.S. and buy a more expensive, quality guitar strap.\n",
            "378 I am rather pleased with these par lights! They are very bright. The sound active and DMX features both work extremely well! The build quality is decent and the colors are very vibrant. For this level of quality at such a good price makes this par light a great deal. I personally use these lights for my speaker stand skrims but they are also perfect for up lighting.\n",
            "379 I ordered the pair and only one light came in. Buyer beware. Light functions but you should not expect more then the money you spent for it.\n",
            "380 great mic for a great price its a voice microphone\n",
            "381 I was really looking forward to using this keyboard due to it having all of the features that I needed at it's particular price point. When I opened it up, it didn't even come in it's own box. It's box was just the shipping box. Immediately after taking it out of the box, I heard this rattle as if something was loose inside and it fell through the entire keyboard  like a rain stick. I checked out all of the keys individually and they all worked except for a C# on the lowest octave.\n",
            "382 I was afraid to order this after reading so many bad reviews about holes not lining up. So I have to weigh in and say that it fits my 1994 Black Label Fender P-Bass perfectly. It was a tight fit, but after some wiggling and strategic pressing around the pickups, it finally sat down. My original pickguard was an off white (originally white, but it aged), on a cream/off white body. I wasn't a fan of the look, so I got the Tortoise Shell color. See my photo to see how it turned out!\n",
            "383 Puts your extra picks right where you need them.\n",
            "384 Just Hung up one of my Strats. Quickly mounted on the wall above my piano and it seems to be quite secure. I have some heavier guitars and for them I would probably use Toggle bolts instead of the included Screws and mollies but for most of my lighter weight Fenders this is perfect.\n",
            "385 Does everything I need it to do, gets the instrument out of the way, on but not against the wall and in a good place to be seen. This works even if you don't have a stud where you want to put it, I just nail it to the wall, the white plastic things they included looked like they might make some big holes. It also looks good when the instrument isn't hanging on it. I have 3 now, they take about 4 or 5 days to arrive.\n",
            "386 The craftmanship on this is incredible, great stich work, real leather and I have no words to describe how it feels, Take a look at the closeup picture I attached, so that you can see the quality, I like this better than the Levi's or any other brand out there. 1000000% recomended\n",
            "387 Got the Super 55 Deluxe for my wife to use when rehearsing in home studio. She was using a $100 Sennheiser E835 Dynamic Cardioid and *hated* it so I decided to fix that situation. With no change other than plugging in the Shure Super 55, adjust input trim on mixer and some minor EQ, the difference in her voice was remarkable. Very even and consistent response across vocal frequency range. Some presence enhancement,  subtle and helps vocals punch through mix. Another reviewer mentioned the Shure Super 55 may have some compression characteristics -- I agree and it's a good thing; she is able to get right up to the mic, soft or screaming, it doesn't peg the meter (much) on my board. Another thing is that she *loves* the look of the Super 55 Deluxe; puts her in the mood for that 40's/50's jazz stuff she does so well :) Overall - we are very happy with the Super 55 Deluxe and I will probably get a second one for myself soon.\n",

            "390 Fun and easy to install. Looks pretty cool too. Not sure how long they'll hold up after I install the strings and start practicing bends. Although they are thin, I still feel an slight edge when I run my fingers across them. We'll see,... kinda skeptical on how long these will last.\n",
            "391 These are great lights for the cost.  Currently have 17 in use for our theater. We built pyramids for a theater production. We have 5 lights filling the pyramid shape.  Been a great effect with huge applause for just the lighting.\n",
            "392 I have 3 daughters and last year I bought my oldest a guitar.  She's been kind of luke warm ever since getting one but my middle daughter has been asking for one for a while now, so this was her birthday gift.  It's what you'd expect it to be....it's a Fender, but it's a Squier...so it's going to be mass produced \"alright\" quality for the most part, but not stellar by any means.  Nevertheless, it gets the job done (getting someone young interested in the learning process).  Be prepared to tighten down the various screws and nuts on the guitar when it arrives (this is why I docked them one star).  Personally I dislike strats, but this seemed like the best option to get my kids started on guitar.\n",

            "394 This is a solid microphone.\n",
            "395 I was a bit disappointed when I received this guitar set.  The guitar itself has a very visible paint or glue drip.  Also, the description said it had an extra SET of stings, but there is only one included\n",
            "396 This is a decent case for 100 bucks. I've owned mine approx 1.5 yrs but have not used for gigging until recently. There are 3 hinges that work fairly well. Surprisingly the carring handle has broken off and the humidifier is a B!*Ch to remove so I use a sound hole humidifier.\n",
            "397 The hangers worked great. I did not use the provided screws or mollies. I used larger screws and went into studs. I hung a Takamine PD5, probably my heaviest guitar. No issues. I would recommend.\n",
            "398 I bought the classical guitar case. It fits my Ruben Flores 1200 perfectly. I had my doubts for the low price. It's very solid constructed. It comes with two keys for a lockable latch. It has a nice surface texture that feels like leather. The whole thing feels really well-built.\n",
            "399 NOT as advertised.  They claim these are Rapco Horizon Cables, but they are actually Stagemaster - whoever that is.  Rapco Horizon cables offer a lifetime warranty and they LAST!!!  I have some that are just going bad after 14 years of weekly use.  This is a bait and switch - do NOT be deceived like I was.\n",
            "400 Great pickguard!  Used on my MIM strat project.  Purchased a black MIM body from amazon and this 3ply black with white border pickguard from musiclily.  Guitar looks awesome!  This is a very quality product.  Especially for the price.  My guitar body didn't have pickguard holes, so I had to drill them.  I just taped this pickguard down in place and drilled the holes.  I am really happy with the result!\n",

            "403 Perfect gauge for me. Easy to strum or pick with. Does not slip off my fingers easily. Previously I bought Fender's Medium picks, however they are too thin despite also labeled as Medium. I have also tried many other brands, but most of them are too slippery for me to grip on. These picks work best for me. Perhaps you should not choose color White like I do. It looks too plain and rather yellowish.\n",
            "404 Kit is awesome. I play in my garage just for personal enjoyment not for performances or anything. Once you take the time to break down all the settings, your able to dial in pretty much any kit and sound. With the expansion options and the relatively inexpensive parts expanding is easy and fun.\n",
            "405 Pretty simple product at good price. Some damping and absorption of extraneous sound due to sharp angles.... Cool factor doesn't hurt none.\n",
            "406 Nice guitar stand. Good quality construction and slim look. Would recommend.\n",
            "407 Never lose your pick again. This is an essential item in your repertoire of gadgets for guitar players. I tried this almost on every surface I could possibly stick it to, and every time it worked great (except on dry wall...). Needless to say, this is designed for guitars, so any guitar you have, you can stick it to. No adhesive, no tape, no mess. Just press, and there you have it. Check the pics. I love Ernie Ball products, and this is another winner. Patent pending, made in China.\n",

            "409 This is my third case I have purchased from you and as always very satisfied. Cases are well made great for storage and giging and regular runabouts. (?) on air travel. But overall satisfied with transaction. Will keep on doing business. . CRM\n",

            "412 This hangar works very well and it is especially nice that it comes with the wall anchors and screws.  Installation and adjustment is super easy and it holds my guitars securely.  Note that the adjustment is by rotation of the arms to adapt to the neck size of your guitar.  The arms are padded to protect the finish on your guitar.\n",
            "413 First of all i would say that for the price, this is something you don't want to let pass. Dont be fooled for the size, these lights are just more than bright. I had some problems with one light out of 4, but customer service was able to help me asap. DMX controls, they work amazing. I would highly recommend these lights to anybody.  In the picture i added i have just one of them lights in purple, wich i used on for the floor.\n",
            "414 Has a great sound to it, a really wonderful tone. I would highly recommend it over any other phaser in the same price range and maybe double its price range, nothing can touch it in terms of its sonic quality, and it's a great bargain for the money. No hum and coloring of tone. Built like a tank and has a small foot print on your board. Sounds very close to the MXR Phase 90, just a bit more suttle and a lot smaller. I was a little worried after I ordered the pedal. Being used to a Mutron Bi-Phase, I didn't know how the Donner would perform. BOY, was I surprised. Not only could I get that Van Halen phase sound, I also got a great classic Alabama, Waylon sound too. It is built rugged and simple. Who could ask for more.\n",

It's very well-made with really good quality zippers and construction, with roomy front and side pouches I haven't even used yet. :) The bag comes with 10 dividers (I only used 8...description says it comes with 8, but I'm pretty sure I got 10) which can be repositioned with velcro (probably much neater than I've done here).\n",

            "421 Here's the thing about XLR cables. If they work, they work and you never notice them. If they don't work, they create more of an issue than you can dream. I purchased 2 CBI cables and received them within the appropriate time line and they were well packed. However, as you will see in the photos below, one of the cables was absolutely a terrible cable to send out. The connectors were covered in some sort of sticky mess and the Phillips screw was completely stripped out on of the connectors. Terrible terrible experience for me. I will attempt to return this cable and receive another from the company.\n",

            "424 These guitar straps are downright luxurious. So comfortable and absolutely beautiful. I have two beautiful Dixon Hummingbirds, and these are the only straps that are just as beautiful as my guitars. I loved the first one I bought so much that I bought two more. I put one on on my pretty Schecter SIII Custom electric guitar as well. They are really well made. I have not seen better quality on another strap I've owned.\n",

            "427 Do not let the low price fool you! This is an incredible device with the free mixing software. It has been years since i tracked anything. Back then everything was Solid State and Analogue. With this Scarlett Solo, a moderate computer, and a large monitor (i stress large because there is too much control with the software), you can really lay down some serious tracks.\n",
            "428 I own 4 Gibsons and 3 Fenders. And this guitar. I've played this against MIM Fender Teles and IMO, this guitar sounds better, even with just the stock pups. No, seriously. My guitar guy says the same thing. I put Ernie Ball 9s on mine and it plays really good. I don't care where it's made nor what it costs, it is a great guitar for the money. Very solid build and save for a few rough fret edges it came in great shape. A tele with some distortion is one of life's great sounds IMO. Recommended. Cheers\n",
            "429 Love this cable! I bought a purple (red & blue knitted) one and a green one. Both look great, sound clean, and work fantastic. I only need to stand a few feet away from my amp, so I'm good with 10 feet. But wanted to point out its not super long. If you like to walk around....get a longer one.\n",
            "430 Overpriced. You should get a coupe dozen for this price. Buy some tubing at a home improvement store, drill holes in it, cut them apart and make your own. The tubing costs less than $.50/foot and you can make 10. I am an orchestra teacher and I've made thousands of these.\n",
            "431 This is the best deal on a pedal board ever! I have lots of pedals so I may be buying second one in the future. If you want it angled it can easily to do just that will a screw driver and some washers.\n",
            "432 First off this is NOT a leather strap. Only the ends are leather. I've owned this model in 3\" several times. I keep coming back because of the style. But the glue they use to piece the front and back together cannot stand sweat. So it separates pretty quickly, after about 4 uses. The sad thing is the strap is made quite well except for the plastic end that holds the nylon strap part to it. If it breaks, your $2000 plus guitar takes a dive. Using strap locks, I would prefer if they used a metal part instead of the plastic part. But the separation is a real downer. All they would have to do is sew or use better glue. They must know this is a factory defect, but for many years now all my straps have done the same exact separation in the same exact place. Total I have purchased a dozen of these straps for my guitars.\n",

            "436 I saved my money for retirement, so I could afford a quality musical instrument. I did all my online research, and tested many guitars at music shops. Some felt like works of art, flashy, shiny, with that dipped in plastic look and feel. The Jim Dandy looked old style with jumbo fret markers, and a satin type finish...I thought it was old! I strummed a few chords and it played ok. I liked the short size and bought a back pack style case. I ride my bike two miles with my guitar every day to jam with friends at the Marina. This Gretsch Jim Dandy kicks mine and everyone that hears or plays it's butt! It stays in tune and the sound it puts out, tho not too loud, is pure nostalgia at it's finest! She cries the blues, yet if you finger pick a happy tune, you can't stop from smiling. This may not be an expensive instrument, but it's a true classic.\n",
            "437 im not sure why this stand only gets a 3star rating.it took less than 10 minutes to put together and works great.ive attached a pick.id buy another.\n",
            "438 I have owned two Martins over the years. I have been playing only electric guitars the last many years. I came across some old songs I wrote for the acoustic guitar. I tested several guitars because I wanted a nice kick back acoustic that covered all the base and mids I remember from the Martin coffee house days. I did not like the new guitars, they did not sound the way I remember them. I walked out of my favorite music stores with out any guitar. My friend told me to try a Canadian made guitar a Seagull. I never heard of them. I saw a few for sale used, that's good because I wanted an old one. I tested a 1996 S6 Seagull and the sound, power and tone from this guitar was fantastic. I bought it, set the action very low and put some #9 strings one it. This cedar top has a magic to it and I am pleased with this one. Just as fine to play as the crazy priced guitars.\n",
            "439 This is a practical and versatile instrument tuner. It includes a metronome and tone generator and a variety of settings. The clamp attaches easily to an instrument and the tuner can rotate to the angle that is convenient for seeing it. The power and function buttons are easy to use. This does have a few limitations, such as the frequency range limit of 435-445 hz. The meter shows you if you are flat or sharp or right on the note, and this is a precise tuner - you won't get the green light if you are slightly off. I have tried multiple tuners and this one is good, with the extra features that make it a great value and go to accessory for musicians. I received a sample at no cost for my honest, unbiased review.\n",
            "440 Great quality mount and price. The inner clamp is padded which prevents scratches. However, no adapter in package. Though you won't need one for most standard threads. Still, an adapter would have been nice for smaller threads.\n",
            "441 Loving these vintage springs on my vintage strat. They have a good tension and great stability. If you are floating your bridge and want the most out of your springs than these are the way to go.\n",

            "444 This product so far has been absolutely stunning. I believe that it most definitely CAN be used for professional soundtracks and music. But duh, FL Studio is for the super duper professionals, blah, blah, blah. I use it for my YouTube channel it's been nothing but wonders for me! It's funny because when I first received the item, I SUCKED at doing anything on this software. Then, five days later of experience and watching about two videos on this, I felt like a confident pro! If you're frustrated at first with the software then don't fret. You're not the only one, and you'll get the hang of it.\n",
            "445 OMG! This is perfect ! I was hesitant to go drilling a hole in my Ukelele but wanted to have the option of amplification. This fit the bill with easy quick insallation ! No miss no fuss and it produces great ,clear wonderful sounds . I placed the pads in a triangular formation from the bridge down to the sound hole. I did take a tip from someone and got glued the solder joints on the piezos for added protection. 30 minutes total install time and that's cuz I have big club hands lol  . This is a true bargain quality piece comparable to the KK mini but about 80.00 $ cheaper .  In fact I used the KK installation video online to do the job . Highly recommended !\n",
            "446 Great item, I installed it with no problems, I ordered together with the Shure A26X 3 Inch extension,following the recommendations of one reviewer here on Amazon, I'm glad I did, my Keyboard it's the Yamaha PSR S900, which has built in speakers and makes the keyboard \"thicker/Higher\" than a regular keyboard so the extension it's definitely needed. I also order the OnStage Boom stand arm, everything works great I also ordered[To arrive Thursday] the quick clip extension just to make it easier to remove.\n",

            "449 It's really flexible on how you're planning to put on top of it. The only small con is the top surface, you might wanna get a cheap Ikea board for it so you can throw anything. I put my guitar amp head (around 40lbs I think), and two monitor speakers without a problem. Love it!\n",

            "451 Line 6 Relay G10 is very awesome. I had been in the market for quite some time when I saw this being advertised. My friends have other systems and they all have a chord leading to a small pack they wear on their hip. I didn't want the added \"baggage' to carry as I also have in ear monitors that have said \"baggage\". This thing performs through my entire house and on stage. It's a wonderful edition to my gear most definitely CHARGE PLUG AND PLAY. You will not regret it!\n",
            "452 Bought this for the brass tip, didn't need the rest. Just wanted to beef up my Zakk Wylde Les Paul Custom Plus to make all the gold hardware match. Does the job perfectly!! But be warned: the added weight of the metal gives the switch a much heavier and thicker clicking sound when switching from pup positions. It doesnt bother me because I play metal and this sound doesnt come through the amp. But for you clean players, this heavy clunk might be audible through your amp. However, I would still give it a shot and see if you like it and can even hear it because it looks great and everyone hears their music differently! And I actually like the added chunky feel. Makes my Grail feel just a bit more tough!\n",
            "453 I purchased these for my oldest son. He plays multiple instruments and had talked about wanting some thumbpicks for his acoustic guitar. I'd much rather purchase items to enhance his musical abilities than video games any day!\n",
            "454 I purchased this from a different store with a gift card. It lasted less than 10 string changes. The design could be easily remedied by using a metal shaft instead of a piece of plastic. After it broke, it took about 10 minutes for me to drill the hole out a little and then put a screw in there. Works fine now. If you are up for purchasing a thing that's going to last a few times and then spend a little time fixing it, then this is your product!\n",
            "455 This was a excellent purchase ! I struggled to find a stand that would allow me to use my bass pedals with my keyboards. I just couldn't find a stand wide enough . This stand was absolutely perfect ! Good heavy duty construction. Quality product !\n",
            "456 Cuts strings perfectly....had no problems even with very light gauged strings...4 instead of 5 stars because it stays open, however, it was easily fixed by simply using a rubber band.\n",
            "457 This is a nice stand, but it doesn't work great for my concert-sized ukulele.  It's definitely durable and adjustable, but it's a little too large for my instrument.  I have tried to pull the legs of the stand closer together in order to better accommodate the size of my ukulele, but in doing that, it feels a bit unstable.  If you're looking for a compact, inexpensive stand, I would definitely recommend this one, but just be aware that it might not work as well for smaller instruments.\n",
            "458 I needed a smaller pedalboard for my solo setup and considered building one. When I saw the price on this one I decided to try it. Awesome. I fit a large amp pedal, EQ pedal, loop pedal, loop controller pedal and surge protector on this bad boy with room to spare. Well made and packs up compactly. Before you break out the plywood and Velcro give this pedalboard a go.\n",
            "459 Having a blast!  Never played before today. Took abou an hour and a half to put together. Had to use a LARGE slotted screw driver to ease the clamps open to accept posts with a bit of a twist of the screw driver; once in, they slid all the way in with a bit of help with a few taps of a rubber mallet.  Now it's all together and very snug. Other than that it was an easy paint-by-number set up. The initial sound is great. I'll have to tweak cymbal #3 - (ride) it seems a bit quiet when I hit it. But hitting the button on the head comes out full and loud. So I'll figure that out eventually. Of course that only happens on some of the different kits to choose from. Anyway, from a tenor saxophonist's first time on a full drum set, this is fantastic!\n",
            "460 Great pups!\n",
            "461 These caps sound awesome, never knew how much tone these provide!\n",
            "462 I love this little guy. I was looking for a simple combo amp to use at the church I play at. This amp is plenty loud, and has great sound quality. That's it. No frills. And it looks cool too.\n",
            "463 I struggled for a while to find a good ergonomic position to hold my guitar. Footrests didn't work well for my practice space and somewhat longer-than-average torso, and I always felt my right leg had to be too far outward. I thought this product was a bit expensive at first for what it is - metal and velcro - but it solved everything for me.\n",
            "464 Very nice pickguard.  Fit perfectly.\n",
            "465 Question:  Are you better off with a hard case? The problem with ukes is that they can get squished.  Also, it's a soprano ukulele!! How much can a hard case weigh?  If you have a hard case, you can throw it in the trunk of your car, pile things on top of it...\n",
            "466 Pretty difficult for Boss to mess this up. Molded plastic box with plastic hinges and space for three pedals (see photos). In fact, if it didn't have the Boss logo pressed into it, this could just as easily be a case for a cordless drill. So long as you know what you are buying, youll probably be pleased.\n",
            "467 I wanted to add karaoke to my services for my mobile DJ business and was looking for something that didn't cost and arm and a leg. I wanted to find something mobile, easy to set-up & affordable. After reading reviews, it was a no brainer so I made the purchase. The stand is sturdy, light, portable & very easy to set-up. I have my 20\" Sharp Aquos mounted on it (see pictures uploaded), and it took me less than five minutes to set up! The only complaint I have is the screws for the mic holders do not fit. They are a tad too big. Either the screws are too big or the holes were not made large enough. It's no big deal. I highly recommend this product. Buy it!!!\n",
            "468 This is a great case the only reason I didn't give it five stars is cause there is no place for the basic cables for the controller power chord and USB\n",
            "469 Within a month of buying the device, the door that covers the SD card snapped off - a common problem with these recorders. Very poorly engineered.\n",
            "470 I now have eight of these.  I enjoy seeing my instruments, and feel confident they are safely off the floor away from little monsters.  I didn't understand they came in different woods so they don't all match.  No matter, they still work well.  I wasn't real sure about the mounting screws that came with them.  However, they have been up a couple of years and no problem at all.  Note, I am not hanging mandolins which are a bit heavier.  I have tenor and soprano ukuleles.  Second note: the cushioned part that holds the instrument comes in different sizes, the narrow size is the one you need for thru tuners.\n",
            "471 Great little mouthpiece sleeve that fits my Otto Link hard rubber tenor sax mouthpiece near-perfectly!\n",
            "472 Adds a nice touch of originality. I paired these with a Fender tweed strap, but maybe it is a little bit of overkill having the F sign everywhere (\"Ok ok we KNOW it is a Fender, come on!\"). They are kind of massive when installed, doesn't look bad but just bulky. Only problem I had is that I had previously installed a set of Dunlop straplocks, and when substituting them for these, the new Fender screw fell kind of short, and never got tight, they always stayed turning around when screwing them. So I had to use the previous Dunlop screws with the new Fender ones, and it worked like a charm. Not a problem of the product, but if one has used something else before, one might have these kinds of issues later. Not as easy to lock into the guitar as other models, this one requires two fingers to adjust, instead of for instance Dunlops, with just a central button. Just be sure that your guitar is strapped when you let it go!\n",
            "473 At first I hesitated because $30 seemed a lot for a mic stand but I decided to just keep the order. It came in about 4 days immediately and I set it up. Wow the quality is amazing. It extends pretty high and far. I was worried at first it would be too small but it soon proved me wrong. There are no flaws. I will definitely order another one soon for my second mic. This product was great and there's a reason this was rated 5 Stars. Great for home studio budgets. Highly recommend!\n",
            "474 100% satisfied. After scraping off the nasty blobs of gunk, a few small drops of this (and some rubbing) restored an almost unusable 30 year old rosewood fretboard. If only it could add some metal to the worn frets...\n",
            "475 For a cheap, off-brand instrument, it plays excellently and resonates very well. The bass feels very sturdy and looks fantastic in person. It definitely needs better strings, but what new instrument doesn't? I haven't tried amplifying it, and I honestly don't plan to, as I only wanted it for the acoustic properties to practice without having to drape myself in cables. The neck is comfortable, the body is well-assembled, and having two strap buttons opposed to the usual single one on most acoustic basses is a welcome feature. The bridge is also very nice: the last acoustic I had, I kept losing bridge pins, so not having to deal with those was a main drawing point for this bass for me.\n",
            "476 Looks great on my sons fender acustic!  Was easy to put on\n",
            "477 This is a great well made pedal board for my home needs. Really well made and the power cord and carry bag for the price is a bonus, all I needed was some 6\" patch cords and attach the included Velcro and good to go.\n",
            "478 I like it.  It fits my cutaway guitar no problemo.  Not sure why others had trouble with it...\n",
            "479 I love these. They look awesome and the oblong shape really helps keep the strap on. I did have to use my previous screws because the ones they came with were just a bit too small. I don't mind the black screws since my new knobs are black and gold.\n",
            "480 I have nothing bad to say about this stand. It works and it gets the job done. I use it at home,  and I have placed it in a corner of the room with 3 electric guitars, one acoustic, and one bass.\n",
            "481 I have been slowly replacing all of the hardware on my old harmony stratocaster with Fender parts. These had a huge impact as my guitar now stays in tune. Excellent price to quality ratio. Would recommend to a friend.  Looks great as well.\n",
            "482 These cables are perfect for pedalboards that need a little more reach than average. They aren't as cheap looking as other budget cables.\n",
            "483 This foam windscreens are a little bit smaller than I had hoped. They will fit most microphones, but unfortunately my Blue Yeti is too large to comfortably fit these covers on. Even after stretching the foam and muscling it on, the foam still leaves a bit of the microphone's mesh uncovered. I'll attach some photos of how these windscreens fit different types of microphones.\n",
            "484 I've been playing ProMark 747s for decades....  because my wife likes Porcupine Tree and Gavin Harrison (so do I), she surprised me with a pair of these and I was blown away.  Great grip and great feel.  I've never played with grippy anything but I sure do love it.  I did finally break the pair after some time and it's time for a new pair....  I just with I could roll them on a flat surface to be sure they're STRAIGHT and not warped which I've been bitten by before with online stick purchases.  Here they were before breakage.\n",
            "485 Great light, bright for its size\n",
            "486 Top quality multi ply material...I made double pickguards for my Everly Brothers  J 180 ...had just enough material...it came out awesome...looks awesome...you be the judge\n",
            "487 Impressive brightness, 30 beam angle, and fixture is well-built. Saving static colors was tricky at first, but the vendor was more than helpful with tech support. Once your color is set manually, if you press setup again after setting the color you wanted, you will have the same color next time you power it back up. Overall, impressed considering the cost and brightness. Flawless DMX control!\n",
            "488 This microphone bundle was more than worth the price. The sound quality is excellent. The setup is relatively easy. I use it with a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 which already has phantom power built in. Put the gain at about halfway and it was good to go. Very pleased with it and will most likely be buying another one soon to add to my home recording studio.\n",
            "489 I've been playing for 9 years and was worried this won't be on par with the mid-end guitar I've been using. The guitar both looks and feels great. The finish is very well done. It's got a warm and full sound to it that I really enjoyed, that at times I found myself reluctant to stop playing. And I was really pleased with how smooth the fretting was, it felt like it took less effort to move between the frets and press down than on several guitars I've played on previously.\n",
            "490 Pickguard was a perfect fit for my Squier bass partscaster. It fit all pickup and screw holes dead on. Very happy.\n",
            "491 Quality is questionable; had to glue brackets that the bridge screw into which raise and lower the bridge to the guitar body. Brackets were not properly set and had fallen out of the guitar during shipping. Some of the guitar strings were broken; it's fun to glue and restring a brand new guitar. Since the repairs the guitar is playing well and sounds ok; no string buzz or anything no thanks to Schecter or Amazons questionable shipping practices...\n",
            "492 Just installed my new pick guard and trem cover.  Looks great and fits perfectly on my Squier Classic Vibe Strat.  The only problem is that a Classic Vibe Strat comes with an 8-hole pick guard, and this one has 11 holes.  Good thing is that the 8 existing holes lined up with 8 holes in the pick guard, and I had to drill the remaining three holes.  But since the pick guard was installed already I knew exactly where to drill them.\n",
            "493 It's may best solid state amps I ever had. Very versatile just one cons I can tell be aware when or need to use external pedals need optimization for work as you intended. It's very tricky (remember it's a modeler amp take this in consideration). But for a Stan-alone application it's the best. Have anything you'll need. Just connect your guitar and start playing as that easy.\n",
            "494 Amazing Fuzz pedal really good sound specially when you mixed with Baby Cry Wah and Tube Blackstar amp.\n",
            "495 these are 7\" tall at the microphone, doesn't matter how you have the legs 7\" is how tall they are.\n",
            "496 I got this for my son for Christmas and he really loves it.  He also as a condenser mic that needs phantom power in order to work.  With this focusrite scarlett 2i2 Audio Interface that eliminates that requirement as it also doubles as phantom power.  The mic is very clear when using this recording device.  He uses the Magix Music Maker to record his music.  It is excellent and he has not had any issues with it at all.  I asked him if there was anything negative about it and he said all he can think of is how perfect it is.  You can adjuster mic volume, very clear, he has not heard any cut outs.  The only con is if you leave it plugged in to the USB when you are not using it your voice will sound static, but he said its an easy fix you just unplug the USB and plug it back in.  By the way he is using an old dell laptop and it works great.\n",
            "497 I wanted to wait a few days and give this guitar some time before I reviewed it. I currently own 2 other Dean guitars including a 12 string and I wanted to say that I bought this guitar based upon the reviews here on Amazon which I most often do. I have to admit I really like Dean humbuckers. This guitar did not disappoint.  It is beautiful, and that shiny chrome-like green neck with silver fret bars is awesome.  This guitar is VERY playable--fits well in my hands and has nice low action. I really like the sound it puts out and it DOES stay in tune contrary to the negative comments I read to the contrary.  I really like these tuners because they a precise. It sounds awesome through my Zoom G5 effects pedal. I agree with the reviewer who said 'buy it now'.  You won't  be sorry.  This is now my main squeeze especially for anything rock. I recorded 4 Iron Maiden songs with it.  Sweet!!!!!!!!  I love this guitar. I just love it.  I can't say that enough.\n",
            "498 Bought a bunch of this and it looks awesome. Sound dampening abilities are limited given it's only 1\". If you're not on a budget consider something like Auralex foam, but if you are a normal person without tons of money, this is just fine.\n",
            "499 Before I put this on my guitar I took off the stock pickguard and lined it up against this one to check the alignment -- it was a perfect match.  I couldn't be happier with how it looks on my Mexican Telecaster. Great deal for $10.\n",
            "500 This necks r just as good as a 4 hundred dollar fender reeck I have built 30 guitars usingthis  neck. They always r a perfect fit great to play on with great response and they have that classic Look. So for 40 bucks you can purchase a fine product for a forth of the same quality.\n",
            "501 I had tusq pins on my Alvarez that had become damaged over the years. Been looking at these for a while and figured I'd give them a try.\n",
            "502 Works wonderfully with my MXL 990 Ribbon Microphone! Feels sturdy, easy to adjust, and keeps the mic well in place! It may not absorb as much sound as some specialty shockmounts, but it works perfectly for what it is.\n",
            "503 Easy to install.  Heavy duty.  I mounted mine in a custom built angled top rack.\n",
            "504 What a great new preamp from Fishman the Platinum Stage. It so small fits in a guitar case.  It gets rid of the low mud tone. In guitar mode the bass is at 150Hz, theres a low cut switch for 30hz, 80Hz, and 160Hz.  The middle is from 200Hz-3.1kHz Q1.3 and treble is at 6kHz.  I like that this is battery powered so I can use it with the Bose S1 Pro and my guitars with LR Baggs or Fishman pickups.  On the Cordoba F7 Paco w Fishman Ellipse it sounds great.  Thanks Fishman #FishmanElectronics #Fishman\n",
            "505 ergonomics and useful.\n",
            "506 At last, a neck cradle that makes sense and has some actual thought put into its design. There's a real popular neck cradle that looks like a rabbit and has a nice leather covering. It's rather expensive and I see\n",
            "507 The cable came just as advertised, it was thick, well made and appealing to the sight and touch. Customer care was excellent and I haven't even used the cable yet. I'm positive it will Proform as good as the company has with its follow up on purchase. This is what anyone who shops hopes for in a company and it is rare in today's consumer goods climate. That you very much and from that I highly recommend this product to all customers seeking cables for there Pro gear. DJ Sinista 1 -Alwayz Mobile Productions.\n",

            "509 Great Unit./....good price....and works well\n",
            "510 Haven't had a chance to really use them other than playing with them for a little bit just to check them out. I'm impressed by the colors, and the wide variety of choices. The price is not bad at all!\n",
            "511 UPDATE THE CONTROLLER BROKE AGAIN. MIC KNOB BROKE THEN THE LEVEL KBOB BROKE\n",
            "512 The first unit I got had a problem with noise on the line and a cyclic distortion. It turns out that the LM chip was overheating and defective. I received a replacement unit, and it works well. There is only a very slight amount of added static now, compared to my other preamp.\n",
            "513 Love this product. I just got it today and it sound perfect. I was skeptical that it would work, but its a Vox product so I figured I would be safe. So awesome to be able to practice without disturbing neighbors and family.\n",
            "514 Perfect fit for 2001 Mexican Standard Telecaster.  Two protective layers of plastic coating.  Looks great!\n",
            "515 I rewired my les paul good stuff!\n",
            "516 A slick pick holder with a small footprint. It sticks with suction -- just press down and it adheres. It pops on and off without damaging the guitar finish so it can be switched between guitars and placed wherever most advantageous for the player. It disengages with ease for storage and/or transport. I switched out a thinner pick in place of the one included and the device gripped it tightly. Ingenious gadget and modestly priced.\n",
            "517 These were a perfect fit for my pedal board. No hum, no crackling, good solid connections.\n",
            "518 Worked for about a week the the weight of the guitar pulled the sheetrock anchor out of the wall and left a huge hole now. It needs to come with better anchors.\n",
            "519 I have a Gibson Les Paul Standard from 2013 with burstbucker pros.  Supposedly the burstbucker pro is wound to sound like the original PAF (how they actually sounded), while the Classic 57 is wound to the original design specification of PAFs (how they were supposed to be made). I just picked up a gorgeous Gibson ES-335 from 2001 with the Classic 57, and man, I like this way better than the burstbucker pro!  Both are great pickups, but these have such great bite in the lead and smooth in neck I can stop listening to it.  Every note rings so nicely.  Between the 2 pickups I can find great jazzy/bluesy tones and some to just rock out!  I can't say enough about it, except I'm really neglecting my chores with all the time I'm spending now enjoying these!\n",
            "520 Sounds better thank my 400. AE Ibanez. First two had defects not major. First sounded great . And the one I have now great too. I would buy again! Great guitar for experienced players and beginers alike. Hope this helps.\n",
            "521 Not bad for the price.  Worked great for my BC Rich retro makeover.\n",
            "522 New fave strings for my Fender Jaguar & Jazzmaster! It gives my offsets extra balls. Unlike many flats which tend to sound dull/plucky and higher tension, these would still give you enough brightness and liveliness with a surprisingly balanced sound throughout all strings. It will be tuned fast and stays in tuned for weeks, they only need VERY minor tuning every now and then. Even the wounded G doesn't bother me, it's pretty subtle you almost wouldn't feel it. It's actually CHEAP considering how long these strings would last.\n",
            "523 Unfortunately this switch creates a large pop when switch on or off. For a DJ or game announcer it is entirely unacceptable to have a big pop every time the mic mutes or un-mutes. It would have only added a very small margin to have done this right. The engineer in me wanted to take it apart and add a resister and cap to fix the problem. I chose to return it.\n",
            "524 Does not fit all guitars but it's cheap so no complaints really makes my band setup appear more professional.\n",
            "525 Hello guys, I'm very disappointed with my purchase... I throw up money with poor plastic. I opened the stick and \"easily\" broke very low quality plastic!! U can see attached photo.\n",
            "526 Look good product, design is great but one thing when we record with impact app it the same sound (pluged and unplugged) not different until you connect with guitarcable.\n",
            "527 This board serves the purpose, and if you know what you're doing it is endlessly customizable.  Just got it today, but I have bg plans for making it work for me. As a good platform for pedals, it's pretty solid.\n",
            "528 Easy to use, clear sound, doesn't compromise your pedal board space. Perfect for me!!\n",
            "529 I got this to replace the bridge pickup on my squire strat. I was skeptical that it would really make much difference, but my feedback problem was solved, and the tone is much warmer and cleaner (the old pickup was just awful). I read comments saying that the green wire goes with the red and the white is hot. Mine came with the red wire as hot, and I didn't change that. It works, and it definitely sounds like a beige pickup is supposed to, so it think you should just trust whatever setup the factory gives you. Also, I know other people explained this, but many said they had to enlarge the pickup hole to accommodate the pickup. You DO NOT. It takes a bit of patience but if you are careful, you can slip it in with no modifications.if you are looking to upgrade a cheap guitar, you should be pretty well satisfied with this pickup.\n",
            "530 I put these knobs on my squire strat, my epi sg, and an off brand strat. They all fit easily enough (a bit snug but I prefer that). They are very heavy and solid feeling. Ive had them on the guitar pictured since I got them a few months ago and I haven't had any problems. I did kind of dent the inside of a gold one as I put it on my squire, so you do have to be careful when installing. Also, as people have said, the black knobs have no hole in the chin to tighten or loosen. As far as I can tell, this is about the best value you can get for these style knobs, and I do not think you will be disappointed with them.\n",
            "531 Best tone I've ever played... Personally, this pedal played with my mustang V solid state amp just make it sound unbelievably good... Every not I feel it so delicate, et powerful. This pedal is very subtle in it's effect, but for those with an ear to listen can tell the amazing rich tone this pedal produces. Please connect it on the FX send return channels of your amp, otherwise if placed in front the pre amp of the pedal will create a little noise...\n",
            "532 After a string change the tips next to the end started chipping away.\n",
            "533 I have a 1950s Fender tweed amp, so I wanted to get this strap to match it. It is a perfect match! The leather on the ends is a bit lighter than in the product picture, but it's fine. I love that the stripe is Fender tweed, which any musician should recognize. It's not garish -- it's a subtle statement. The feel of the fabric is nice, and it isn't too stiff like some straps are. All in all, it was a good purchase.\n",
            "534 I have never used AKG microphones before. I decided to take a chance on this from all the great reviews. They were right! I used this to record a Taylor 914CE, the sound was chrisp, great mid and just enough low to not overpower the sound. I totally recommend this for vocals and acoustic guitar recording!\n",
            "535 It's great bass rosin. I have tried Pop's, Nyman, and Kolstein. I like Pop's and Kolstein the best. Pop's (when fresh) is the stickiest. Nyman is hard and powdery. Kolstein is very sticky and there is almost no powder at all. There is something special in their formulation. I believe Kolstein includes wax in their rosin recipe, which keeps dust from forming. The other benefit of Kolstein is that it lasts for a very long time on the shelf. Pop's will dry out in less than 2 years. Some people will only use Pop's for a few months before throwing it away. I go back and forth between Kolstein and Pop's. I still can't decide which is my favorite. But them both and try it out.\n",
            "536 So far so good. Never heard of Lazarro and who cares? The saxophone can perform. The brand doesn't matter. It is just a label. I'm on month 5 and it is holding up. Play it everyday. Upgraded the mouthpiece to a Clark Forbes Debut mouthpiece. The reeds that the sax comes with isn't that great. Mine came with Lazarro reeds 2 1/2 strength and now I use D'Addario Select Jazz reeds 3S and it does the trick.  If you know how to take care of the saxophone it'll last. Well worth the investment. This is the perfect saxophone for those looking for a great instrument without paying hundreds to thousands of dollars.\n",
            "537 I first considered the Cordoba concert ukulele because it was on every list of the best beginner ukes, and I am so happy with my choice! It took about a week to stretch the strings and stay in tune, but the Cordoba sounds amazing. My daughter has a cheaper soprano uke and the Cordoba has a noticeably clearer sound and is much lighter weight. It just feels great in my hands. I tried some no-drill straps, but ultimately chose to add a strap button with no problem. I saw some reviews about quality control issues on the finish, and I did find a rough spot on the back (see photo). This was not an issue for me, but I'd suggest checking for this. Otherwise, I love everything about my Cordoba ukulele and highly recommend it for beginners. From my experience so far, it's worth spending a little more to get a quality instrument.\n",
            "538 Bought a 3 pack. Liked em so much I bought three more.\n",
            "539 these things are cheapo plastic.  i was very disappointed with the flimsy feel.  i added a photo of my Audio Technica 2020 loaded in one of these cheapo mounts.  the description said metal construction. it is not.  beware of this thing.  the more I look at it the sadder I get.  junk.\n",
            "540 I played a wedding today using the Alaska picks on my thumb and ring finger.  They were very comfortable and stayed on my finger well without being to tight.  For my fingers I cut the extra piece off and just used the smaller part.  It fits snug under my nail and is the perfect length. For my thumb I used the full size of the pick and it worked great.  The material is easy to bend and shape using a file and buffing blocks.  This produces a naturally smooth sound that you can get with your nails.  I got the medium size. They fit great on all my fingers but I might try the larger version for my thumb but the medium works great if you bend the plastic back and it makes it looser around the thumb.\n",
            "541 Great product and price. I bought these panels for a home studio, mostly for mixing a tracking as I don't do much live recording there. There is definitely a difference and the early reflections from the monitors are lessened (to my ears anyway). They did the job I needed and they look good too! I opted to pin them to the wall with t-pins instead of using adhesive. For my use it works well and I can remove them with little or no damage to the wall. I ordered a second box to put in a pattern on the one remain wall that could use some treatment.\n",

            "548 It seriously sounds better than it has any right to at this price range, and I love it.  Great if you want to do some recording in an area that is not sound treated that you can't get away with using a condenser microphone in.  It has a lot of character as it's frequency response is far from flat.  Attenuation of the lows and a pretty beefy boost in the presence without going too bright.  It's a bit louder that the Shure sm58, but not hugely.  Still needs quite a bit of preamp, about 70% up on my preamp to remain in unity on my mixer for reasonable recording levels.  It's got a good sound to it.  I think it's super short sighted of Behringer to fail to include the frequency profile of this microphone on the Amazon store page, but don't worry I've got you all covered.  The picture attached is a document included with my microphone which SHOULD have been on this store page, and will give you an idea of what this microphone will sound like.\n",
            "549 I really wanted this pedal to work out for me but I am really disappointed in the external footswitch. So I am giving it one star so others are made aware of error in owners manual.\n",
            "550 This pickguard is wonderful, didn't have to mod it in any way, and I was concerned because the old one on the guitar is bigger then this one.  Thought I would have some visible holes on the guitar but nope it fit like a glove. Now I have a great looking guitar, oh let's don't forget the price.  Very low price, awesome product came with screws most don't so why buy a name brand at 5 times the cost.\n",
            "551 Simple to install and it works. I have an old Ibanez RG that I just didn't want to fuss with as far as tuning adjustments. Installed this with an extra spring and really tightened up the claw into the body, works as advertised. The coolest part is how you can set your bridge height before the final claw adjustment. Can still dive if I want but I'm just having fun playing the RG again in alternative tuning. I can go from 1/2 step down Van Halen right back up to standard leads w/o having to access the cavity. I may get a Tremol-no for my American Strat as I feel this is too limiting for a more expensive guitar.\n",
            "552 Great nylon strings, just as expected. They worked just fine on my daughter's mini classical guitar. They are as good quality wise as much more expensive strings I've purchased in the past. They are much softer to the touch and easier for her to learn on than my steel strings on my acoustic guitar. They came labeled with both the note name and the string number, which made putting them on easy and quick.\n",
            "553 Well... I guess the truth is this product is not for everyone.\n",
            "554 I actually picked up this bass at my local guitar center used, for $60! I brought it home, wiped it down with some dunlop guitar polish, cleaned and treated the fretboard with lemon oil, and put on a D'Addario Light set of strings. I have $75 invested, and it plays amazing! I've played it through numerous cabs, and record with it. Very happy. Check through the used section at GC first if you don't mind a quick cleaning and restring to save you $125!\n",
            "555 These strings were reccomended to me by an acquaintance of mine during a bass clinic I attended recently.  I ordered them right away.. All i can say is WOW! Excellent tone. It really brightened up my sound. I had gotten used to muddy sounding strings.  I haven't noticed a sticky feeling like others have mentioned, mine are silky smooth. Great playability. Wasn't too concerned about color, But When I installed them on my Ferrari red Carvin LB 70, I fell in love with my bass all over again.  It looks stunning, and I get many comments about my bass now..Others have mentioned that the color wears off quickly, but I don't care, I'll used the color wear as a guage of when to change them..Then neon ones even glow brightly under a black light.  Bass players don't get much credit so why not give them a show and something to talk about.\n",
            "556 I am impressed with this pedal. It works quite well, especially with a guitar ran through it for key reference. We have used it for many different applications, and different styles, and it seems to work under most conditions. I really enjoy the variation you have at your disposal with this pedals settings. You can have 1 or 2 lines of harmony, and you can chose whether they are each higher or lower, and between a 3rd and a 5th or the root note. The ability to control those factors makes a world of difference. I would recommend checking out some of the demo review videos if you are interested in this pedal.\n",
            "557 I loved using this while producing videos with my Canon EOS 6D, but it didn't last long.  When I inserted the battery into the receiver, one of the battery contacts broke off.  Here are some pictures of the receiver mounted on my EOS 6D and a picture showing the broken contact wire.  The battery holder has a bad design because the contacts are weak wire loops and the battery fits very snug and puts a lot of pressure on these weak contacts.  Samson should update the battery holder design.  I still recommend this wonderful wireless system, just something to be aware of.\n",
            "558 I am wanting to replace the stock single coil neck pickup in my 2016 Squier Affinity with a humbucker. This should do just fine. The mounting screws match up perfectly. Cheers!\n",
            "559 Bought this case for a 650mm classical guitar. There is some spare room around the body of this guitar. In the picture attached, you can see a box of strings (3/4\"), fits in between the guitar and case, but with the lid closed, the guitar doesn't move around, it feels secure.\n",
            "560 Great microphone, I use it with my cheap/budget Behringer mixer, the sound is good and if I turn up the gain it will pick up everything in the room. It is great for recording acoustic guitar and vocals, don't start layering the vocals though, it starts to sound kind of weird.\n",
            "561 I was looking for an second inexpensive ukulele for traveling or camping.  To my surprise this is a wonderful ukulele!  Its light weight construction makes its tone warm, bright and rich.  The construction on the instrument is very high quality.  If your looking for a beautifully designed comfortable playing ukulele, look no more.  Even the etching on the body is very nice.  Luna makes a few other designs in this etched series.  So if you don't like this design there are others to choose from.  I would highly recommend Luna's Mahogany Mo's Concert Ukulele to anyone who wants a high quality ukulele without spending a lot of money. And it even comes with a nice soft Luna case.\n",
            "562 Great little pedal with tons of tone! For anyone having noise issues with this guy, put it in the front of your signal chain. It doesn't like sitting behind other gain pedals (very typical big muff trait) put a clean boost behind it and it really goes!\n",
            "563 I was a little skeptical about this case but I went for it. It's for my rented violin that I just picked up. I travel for a living and looking for an alternative to the hard case the violin came in. This one is made of very high quality material, super light, and quality seems great. Fits the 4/4 like a glove and there's room for two bows, rosin compartment and an outer pouch that fits my shoulder rest. Comes with two straps that can make the case be used as a backpack, also came with the cloth to put on top of violin. Love it love it!\n",
            "564 Very easy to put on and looks very realistic and are worth every penny I highly suggest if you want to make your Epiphone look like a Gibson guitar\n",
            "565 I am building a recording studio. Every studio I've been to; you always expect a humongous mixer, a mac, very expensive condenser mic, and black mic cables. I wanted something unique and different. The connectors are sold and very nice! Cable is thick and sturdy. When I bend the cable I don't feel wires moving around inside. Very well made! You will like these cables!\n",
            "566 So far so good. These speakers have a great flat sound for audio MIXING and MASTERING. They can get louder than I thought from the reviews I've read. I'm in a full basement and these are perfect.\n",
            "567 Perfect- the blue is outstanding. Had it customized. Take a close gander at this masterpiece\n",
            "568 Wow! This is a beautiful looking instrument, solidly made, with a nice rich and bright tone, and all for only 38 bucks! Worth every penny and more!\n",
            "569 Prior reviews describing concerns about the handle on this case are accurate.  I bought this case new from GC less than a year ago, have never had it out of my studio, and the handle molding over ball joint is crumbling and falling apart (see photo).  This is not due to abuse, climate or bad design ... it's junk plastic.  Too bad - the fit and finish of this case is perfect for my Gibson Les Paul R8 VOS. I love the design and light weight, but there's no way I'd risk carrying my guitar in it now.  The handle is going to fail at any moment.\n",
            "570 Great fun,and,if you get a Whammy pedal,and ANY BLOODY DELAY(echo pedal),this is cool! if you add more,and run it thru a big amp,AWESOME!\n",
            "571 This is a beautiful, sturdy and easy to install hardwood hanger. The set arrived in great condition with all necessary parts including a quality wall anchor, should you need some. To install this set you need a screwdriver and a drill. This is made in USA and the high quality shows. No funny smells, either.\n",
            "572 Love these Strap Locks.  Easy, fast installation, and they work perfectly.  Have purchased a number of them.  Highly recomemded.\n",
            "573 This is everything you want in a fuzz box.  Mid scoop, custom-dialed mid boost or additional cut, bass boost, noise gate, and a special attack knob to add in certain frequencies to give attack back to the muff sound, if desired.  EHX listened to a decade of online feedback on the NYC 3-knob Big Muff Pi and added every must-have addition into a single pedal.\n",
            "574 Just what inwas specting to keep my mobile recording studio on the go. Don't let the \"cable bag\" fool you, this bag can keep more than just cables and is pretty customizable.  I recommend using it with khanka bags to give extra protection even though the bag is sturdy enough but to keep equipment more in place nice and tight. I would've preffered buying the large size but for now im happy with this one. I would recommend this to a friend and would buy another one again!\n",
            "575 I was surprised when I discovered this mic delivers XLR quality recording. I originally bought it for recording sessions during travel but it stacks up well against a 2x as expensive Rhode XLR mic! I would definitely recommend this mic to anyone looking for a good USB mic.\n",
            "576 great durable case, just like what others have said. it comes with screws n some washers. simple easy to work with.\n",
            "577 Worked ok in a pinch as a last minute purchase.  All of my amp rack patch panels have Neutrik NL4MP connectors, as most of my speakers.  I have some monitors with 1/4\" inputs which I am swapping out with Neutrik NL4MPs.  So no more 1/4\"inputs and no more knock offs for me.  No I will NOT purchase this product again. (Photo shows 'my custom made' 12/4 cable connected to OEM cable connector and panel mount).\n",
            "578 It's perfect, although it's not the simplest of portable stands with its number of parts\n",
            "579 I have four of these I purchased at my local guitar shop didn't buy from amazon. They are the exact same cables however and I think they are far too stiff and rigid. Example you can see visible wrinkles and feel the tension work against you when plugging these into pedals. I mean quite a bit of resistance as in unnecessary amount. Durable yes and that's great but I'm running a pedalboard for guitars Not pullin trucks out of mud pits damn. They do sound okay but nothing special. Look pretty cool too but looks aren't what's getting it done. Overpriced in my opinion as are most fender cables. Not a huge fan and prefer lower profile pancake type patch cables mogami sounds better , easier to work with and the pedals can be kept much neater and closer to save space. That means room for \"more toys!\" Hooked a few pedals together off the board and took a couple pics so you can get an idea of the tension and overall in my opinion sloppy fit of these cables.\n",
            "580 This is not a sturdy stand. This is probably not suitable for a school band room. It is a lightweight, foldable and easily stashed stand that barely holds a three ring binder with 50 pages of fake tab. But it does manage to do this. That's all I wanted. I can keep it folded up and out of the way next to the couch and take it out when I need it. Hands down beats the previous music stand I was using: the floor.\n",
            "581 Excellent with CAD U37 Microphone\n",
            "582 Excellent 2 tier keyboard stand.  It did exactly what I needed it to do, if fact came out better than expected.  Hard to believe it's only $27.  See the before and after photos.\n",
            "583 I received this and a InnoGear Studio Recording Condenser Microphone in exchange for an honest review, and I have to say as a podcaster and host of a radio show that I am able to do online this works amazing well.\n",
            "584 I do like these strings! Are they the best? There are so many personal preferences. Have you ever asked a drummer what double bass drum pedal they like? It is all too subjective, but I can tell you I have so far liked the quality and feel of the Super Slinky Pink!\n",
            "585 I put one of these cheap ass pickups in a kit guitar I built, and it sounds amazing!! No noise at all, and nice clear clean sound, and perfectly crunchy with distortion. Yes!!\n",
            "586 This is the second one Ive purchased, and I have ZERO complaints! These are amazing for hanging guitars. (Ive even got a mini one for my ukulele!) I would recommend these to everyone!!!\n",
            "587 These are great little stands. They are perfect for a \"wherever you need it\" stand. I have one next to my PC studio,making the guitar I'm using closer than my regular 5 guitar stand across the room ,and the other next to my bed (so i always have a guitar handy before and after i sleep ). These are really an amazing value and they hold guitars secure enough for me not to worry about them falling over...Holds my classical acoustics, stratocasters, and jazz bass perfectly....\n",
            "588 This case is rigid yet lightweight. There seems to be plenty of padding (high density Styrofoam?).  In regards to the various sizes, I bought the \"Electric\" size and it fits my new Fender Strat perfectly.  A Fender Strat fits snugly without shifting around.  NOTE:  If you have a Les Paul style guitar, make sure to buy the \"Les Paul\" case.  If you buy this Electric case, which is what I am reviewing here,  your Les Paul will NOT fit!  Inside the case there are a couple of areas where you can put a couple of effects pedals, etc.  If you use mini-pedals, you might be able to fit four.  On the outside there is a large, zippered pocket that will fit a small laptop.  Plus, another zippered pocket that has see-thru mesh material.  The zippers are large and heavy duty.  This case is much easier to carry than your typical hard case.  Plus, it looks classy.  I'm glad I bought it.\n",
            "589 Fabtastic build quality and a very rich fuzzy goodness. Very surprised and not a let down at all. Light fuzz for some distored blues heavy fuzz for some unaudible grunge ruckus not meant to be perceived. Get it or be square, or a circle, or a rhombus. Im not your boss.\n",
            "590 I've bough a few of these. They work good. Not sure what else to say. They are not cheap-looking and hold the violin and the bow on the wall the way they should.\n",
            "591 Really. With this, there is no need for a pedaltrain pedal board. The build quality is the same and you can buy different sizes. The only con I can think of is that they don't provide a small strip of velcro for the bottom part of the board... Yet they provide velcro, most other boards don't.\n",
            "592 Was purchased 6-meter cable I had received was only 1.8 meters I think there is a mistake in the shipment\n",
            "593 I put these strings on an acoustic guitar I recently acquired and they sound great. I was going to try Eric Clapton signature strings but decided I wanted a lighter gauge and ordered these.\n",
            "594 Just got this today and I was pleasantly surprised by the whole package!  Well made case, legs and instrument.  This is my 2nd lap steel, my first was a Recording King.  I'm as pleased if not more because my RK did not have the screw on legs and has a better case and was a bit cheaper.  I will buy another in the future!\n",
            "595 The product description is entirely accurate. Great pickups for my RG Ibanez.\n",
            "596 I will be switching ALL of my snare drums to this head. Why?\n",
            "597 My experience with these have turned out great!\n",
            "598 Great stand for the money, very sturdy you will be happy.\n",
            "599 Nicely made, very secure, very plush on the inside.  And a bit heavy, but it keeps the guitar safe from my klutzy self.\n",
            "600 They came tarnished and discolored, I assume because they were clipped in during storage and shipping, see the pictures. They work with Schallers so you don't have to worry about compatibility and I guess they'll be covered up when I'm playing out, so it's not really that big of a deal but I'm still kind of disappointed. They're also quite a bit bigger but I'm not sure if I hate this, obviously I'm used to smaller Schallers however the larger washer means a more secure connection with my strap and more gold flair. I dunno, I'm still too disappointed with the discoloration.\n",
            "601 Awesome bass. I love it. As some other reviewers have commented this bass is not balanced as a standard solid body bass. the neck is definitely heavier due to the hollow body, but you know, that's the way it goes. I love the sound the hollow body gives you sounds a bit like my acoustic bass. The controls give a nice variety of sounds. I am something of a novice player but wanted to add a hollow body bass to my small collection and this Hofner replica is just the ticket. I think I might replace the strings that it came with as they sound a too metallic for my taste, but they are playable and hold tune well. I was able to play this bass right out of the box once I tuned it. No need for adjusting and didn't have that fret buss some reviewers have commented on. I did notice the neck is slimmer and the strings are closer together than any of my other basses, so that is an adjustment, but didn't take long to get into the swing of things. Fun to play and lightweight. Recommended.\n",
            "602 Mine were very stiff and hard to tune, no smoothness, like there was dirt or grit in the gears.  After installing one of the tuning keys got super stiff and before I could get up to tune the head snapped off.  Had to return entire set...pain in the azz.  Not worth the money in savings, going with Hipshots next.\n",
            "603 Looks amazing paired with the Neewer white/black mic boom arm and whiteout Blue Yeti mic!  Can definitely hear the difference with and without the filter.\n",
            "604 I have been playing for about 25 years on all kinds of gear. My Armand ride and hats never change, The crashes do from time to time. thought I would try a Wuhan crash. it sounds so good. I am so pleasantly surprised. The sound is bright and warm at the same time. the decay is not fast, but not too long either. Even the bell sounds good. I just ordered an 18 Gong crash and a 10 splash. I'll let you know!\n",
            "605 Squier Vintage Modified Jazz Bass.\n",
            "606 Its flimsy and for the awkward angles it sticks in a guitar the Vox device should be metal and sturdy, especially for price.  Mine broke within a week and I am a just a living room player.  I don't know how it broke but it did.  I will upload pictures.\n",
            "607 The neck had the most amazing finish.\n",
            "608 The paint job on this control plate is terrible, the paint is uneven and it even have \"bubble\" like sections.\n",
            "609 After trying to get by without it, I can't imagine trying to use my wah unattached any more. This thing is incredible for attaching a wah to a pedalboard. I just wish they made something just like this for all of my pedals. It's so much more secure than the sticky back stuff.\n",
            "610 This pair of Samson GT Studio Monitors was a great start for me, they aren't your loudest speakers, but they still pack a punch. They can still be mixed on, and give a good all around frequency response. What you want to be careful of is the bass, and mixing bass on these because they will not provide all of the bass that is really there. They are great for mids. The portability is amazing! Along with the fact that you will NOT need an audio interface with these! The Mic plugs directly into the speaker! What a easy and accessible way for an artist to record his vocals, or for a guitarist to to record his notes. Definitely a good investment!\n",
            "611 This box does everything I need it to. It's passive, so it doesn't color the sound, it makes for easy switching between my two sets of monitors, and even has an auxiliary input (RCA connection) with separate volume control (which I use to patch in an xbox. Gotta take 5 from working every once in a while!). The main volume knob is really smooth and has some slight resistance, which makes it feel great when dialing in levels.\n",
            "612 Deep tone and I'm a fan!\n",
            "613 These speakers sound great! I've had a pair of cube Auratone reference monitors for 30 yrs that still sound great but these iLouds are another level. Strong bass, crystal clear mids and highs. They are computer speakers on steroids! The pairing of inboard amp matched perfectly with the drivers makes sure you are getting great sound. They are Bluetooth capable too which I didn't even notice at first because it isn't stated loudly on the package. They aren't inexpensive but neither are good microphones and guitars. If you can afford the price, you will be pleased. Luckily my girlfriend gave me mine for Christmas :) Thank You Love!\n",
            "614 Great value for a hard case, holds lots of guitars, including jaguar, or even a Les Paul. Only issue is... that there's not enough padding,  and some guitars might knock around if You don't add some additional support.\n",
            "615 I Fit 9 Guitars in this. The 2 outside Pads Support 2 more on Stage! It was Cheap compared to Most Stands that Cost $75.00 to $100.00\n",
            "616 Fits my AT2035 like a glove. It DOES cover the entire grill (see picture), just took a little careful finagling to get it on. As some reviewers have said, it does come in a little baggy pressed flat. Mine has expanded nicely in just an afternoon. Doubt if there's much better for my mic at the same price. Highly recommend.\n",
            "617 I like this little small light! It fits in your hand and is a decent output of light. It is dmx which we all know is awesome! Dmx makes the world a little easier to control! The colors are red green blue and white. The only thing I do not like is the way the colors are mixed, you can see the outside of the color when you mix them. I would put one quad led in the fixture so it's all under one lense and there's no bleeding. But other than that this fixture is awesome!\n",
            "618 I've used this for 3 years every Halloween and it always has worked well for me.  After each use, I rinse the tank out with distilled water, then run the unit until just steam comes out, then I dump the water and store the unit dry.  I've heard of people who think you should store the units full of fog juice, but I've heard of people who say the pump gets gunky if you do that.\n",
            "619 This stereo audio jack splitter worked smoothly for me, allowing me to connect 2 headphones to one audio output and also to connect an audio output from a music keyboard to a PC and headphones simultaneously. It's inexpensive and came without any instructions or retail packaging, while it was fine for my needs.\n",
            "620 Wow this thing is so cool I play it threw two orange 8\" cabs it is my favorite practice amp by far. Three knows zero bull $#!+. Once I turn it up around 2 my dog starts to howl no joke I really goes. I'm going to try jamming with it here soon and see how it contends with my brute of a drummer. It can go from clean to pretty dirty but if you really want to get nasty you will need a nice hot humbucker and a distortion pedal. I dug it's sound I didn't bother with a pedal for the first week. Can't go wrong for the price. The little tube in the preamp does really make it sound good.\n",
            "621 Tried a number of noise gates, including the EHX silencer.  This one blows them all away.  Wanted a gate that would allow me to roll off my volume knob in crunch mode and still gate.  This is the only one that really works.  Get it!\n",
            "622 Exactly what I needed to give my studio professional sound quality. Also fairly easy to install, I suggest using t-pins either 1.5in or 2in. Overall very happy with it.\n",
            "623 Can't really complain too much for the price. Had a little spot where the paint had flaked off with some rust underneath, and a couple of the 1/4\" jacks are a little loose in the center (when I tried to tighten the nut, the whole center part of the jack rotated), but overall they're decent. Got all the terminals soldered together and mounted the crossover right to the plate, and everything seems to work just fine.\n",
            "624 Many people think that a electric guitar for around 100 bucks is cheap and sounds terrible. this guitar makes that opinion wrong. this guitar is amazing for the price. the first part of the guitars character you notice is the beautiful red color. it looks beautiful and is really eye catching. the playability is nice with a good action. the strings it comes with are decent factory strings but i changed them anyway for better sound. the volume and tone knobs are cool looking also. the tune o matic bridge helps alot and kept my guitar in tune for days. this guitar also comes with a amp cable , some papers, owners guide, a poster and a big epiphone sticker. who doesnt love stickers? lol. i highly recommend this guitar to beginners and those who have been playing for a while. the sound quality is amazing for the price you get.\n",
            "625 This is my absolute favorite guitar strap amongst those I've purchased.  I'm using it with an antique German lute guitar (wandervogellaute), and the stained glass pattern complements the carved rosette of the sound hole in a vaguely ecclesiastical motif -- while still looking a little hippie.  The lute guitar is extremely lightweight, so I can't speak to how well the strap would hold up a heavy solid body electric guitar, but it seems to be very sturdily made, and is definitely comfortable.\n",
            "626 I really like the simplicity of this bridge. It adjusts easy for string height and length. It comes with all the mounting screws and even a small allen wrench to make the height adjustments. The provided mounting screws are Phillips head screws. The one thing that I missed when I ordered this was the fact that it is not a bridge for string-thru the guitar body placement. The strings dead end to the stop-flair of the plate. I included a picture of this so it may help to make others aware that it is not for string-thru applications. No biggie tho for me, I will use it on another project now.\n",
            "627 They are nice picks but much smaller than they appear in your photos!\n",
            "628 Perfect fit on my 2016 Gibson Les Paul Studio Faded.  I didn't like the original speed knobs because they were too big and clunky-feeling. I was skeptical about these knobs after reading some reviews about poor quality, but I think they're very high quality.  The finish is perfect on them:  No seams, scratches, chips, etc.  I don't know what more someone could expect quality-wise.\n",
            "629 This is the second Neewer boom arm I have purchased, as I have added a second recording capable computer to my battle station for my son to be able to record voice and gameplay. I was pleasantly surprised to see the one thing I disliked about mine had been changed. The mount that attaches to your desk has received an upgrade, allowing for a tighter fit on the boom arm stalk, and a more robust build of the mount overall. My previous mount had a D-shaped hole the boom arm stalk slipped into, which allowed for a lot of movement regardless of how tight you made the clamping screw. It was also equipped with an oversized plastic wingnut for securing the mount to the desk. The upgraded mount rectifies both those issues.\n",
            "630 I received this pedal as a gift.  A compressor is a subtle effect, but it has made a great addition to my pedal board.  The construction of the pedal is solid.  It adds character to chords and enhances leads.  I am currently using the pedal with the sustain at 1 o'clock, the attack at noon, and the volume at 10 o'clock.  The volume provides a very strong boost after 11 o'clock.  Overall, good pedal for the price.\n",
            "631 I wanted something light and compact that can hold a few items, but also fit well in a carry-on and protect the jamstik indoors or out. This case is the perfect solution, and has a nice, adjustable strap as well. Good  durable construction and love having the jamstik label to show it off!\n",
            "632 This was a great value. The wood I received looked outstanding and all the parts were there and fit well. I did some customization to the look and added a couple of other pickups for some diversity but the components I received were of reasonable quality. The guitar looks and plays great after a bit of neck adjustment and setup. Very satisfied.\n",
            "633 There are only a few things I needed to know before I purchased this Alto/Tenor stand.  1.  Did it hold my Tenor and Soprano properly? 2.  Would this particular stand work properly on different surfaces? 3.  Is the design portable and easy for setup for gigs/home use to easily swap for doubled soprano?\n",
            "634 Never levelled frets before I picked this thing up. The concept seemed simple enough. I figured that, due to the weight of this block, little to no pressure would be required and that was a good call.\n",
            "635 This is a very nice Crash / Ride Cymbal. I'm using it for a smaller kit I'm using for a school I'm working at. The kids seem to enjoy the sound, and it's taking a beating. Its holding up to the challenge.\n",
            "636 I had this put together in less than 5 minutes, and made my 3-guitar stand a 4-guitar stand.\n",
            "637 The direct drive assembles and mounts easily. It works well with the right foot and is responsive. Also, it adjusts easily for travel and mallet through. It provides a distinct bass sound freeing up your two hands on the Cajon. It will provide more of a drum kit sound particularly if your Cajon has string sound.\n",
            "638 This is a great, sturdy stand.  I'm using it for a classical and a flamenco guitar, and they are very secure in the stand.  It's also easy to lift either guitar out without banging one into the other even while seated.  I've also set a concert ukulele in the double stand with no problem.\n",
            "639 I bought this stand for church because I been blessed with a soprano and a alto sax and its realy good and reliable and fit in the front poutch of my sax case with no problems (my alto case has a exstra poutch in the front) but one little thing is that the peg can fit a soprano but its just a little lose but it still is safe for soprano sax.\n",
            "640 This pedal is a Tube Screamer, or more correctly an exact replica. When mine came in the mail, I took it out of the box, plugged in my 300ma neg pin power supply, and immediately created a warm, old tube amp tone. I need to get a new, daisy chain chord, so I can use all my pedals at once, but I have no noise issues (those who do have ground loop issues). I also used a pen to push in the two pedal flap hinge pins to remove it and expose the battery compartment. Anyone who removes the Phillips screws to disassemble the pedal (removing the bottom) obviously has problems understanding directions. I will not, however, ever be using batteries.\n",
            "641 I have two of these.  They are rock solid.  I have never had a problem with them, at all.  Very easy to attach to a wall.  Find a stud or use heavy drywall anchors.  I got ones that screw right into the wall and this setup works great.\n",
            "642 Now all I have to do is install these on my Burswood Strat Copy. I know I'm gonna have to drill holes for the locating pins I may even have to drill the tuner holes also. Look forward to getting those crappy, loose, un-smooth, original hardware tuners off this thing.\n",
            "643 We used this one in the middle as seen in the picture holding the white guitar. BIG MISTAKE! The guitar almost was destroyed. This is NOT strong enough to hold a 7 string Schecter Omen guitar. While it worked out and seemed secure at first. Literally 7 days later the guitar had almost fell to the floor. I wouldn't recommend this for heavier guitars. Instead we will be keeping the guitar in the stand where it is safer.\n",
            "644 Great looking additions! !!\n",
            "645 This is real bone. Took a while to file them down to lower the action and replace the plastic parts on a cheap guitar.  But it has improved the sound quality immensely. Well worth it!\n",
            "646 I'm a guitar player who sometimes needs to play bass.  My brother bought me for Christmas.  I was pleasantly surprised by this guitar's feel and sound when unplugged!  It FEELS solid and has great sustain unplugged!  It played easy right out of the box though I will eventually get it set up but I'm not in a rush.  With this gift came a Fender Rumble 25 bass amp that for what I need is perfect and sounds great.  I'm very impressed overall and would recommend this bass to someone looking for a quality instrument without the \"quality\" price tag.\n",
            "647 If you own a J45 these are strings for that guitar. I have a J45 custom and I have tried other strings, but these give it that Gibson sound.\n",
            "648 Using this to get complete control over my signal going into in-ear monitors\n",
            "649 Was excited to get this case at a great price. It was very disappointing to receive the case and find that it would not close and latch completely right out of the box. The top and bottom case just don't seem to fit together right. Seems to be bad quality control.\n",
            "650 So strange this happens on a brand new set of strings. This brand used to be trusted by me.\n",
            "651 While I wasn't sure this would fit my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9, I was pleasantly surprised. Whats impressive is how secure my iPad feels in the grip of the two sets of prongs.\n",
            "652 Was hoping it would be half in longer. Hohner does not seem to carry a size to fit a \"full orchestra\" 40 read model\n",
            "653 Great sound and clarity fair warning use head phones when recording because feed back is a butt\n",
            "654 hello this isa great bass comin from a seasonal 40 something year old i love this bass it has a nice warm tone don't let this price fool ya get off your easy chair and buy this already  its not cheap in a lot of ways very durable and i said it first good for gigs not a starter bass like its called this will hold up thanks alot\n",
            "655 I have uses many condenser microphones in my time and this is the best product I have used. This is now my go to mic. The sound is amazing!!! I have a very deep voice and sing or talking on this mic you can really make out my baritone voice. I highly recommend this product for the beginner to the professional. What a wonderful mic at a great price.\n",
            "656 I love everything Aguilar does, this tlc really makes the difference. Love it\n",
            "657 The cheap black screw broke.\n",
            "658 Wow what a difference from bare fingers. Really nails the tones down with very little effort. Very smooth metal and plastic. Large fit my mits well. Barely opened the middle finger and that was it. Been picking for hours and haven't had and movement so far. I'm a 6'3\" skinny guy so large hands but skinny fingers. Large was perfect. Right up to the first knuckle was snug and comfortable. The thumb picks are even better!\n",
            "659 I needed to replace poorly built, wobbly and ugly green Wilkinson tuners on my Vintage V100PGM ICON Lemon Drop Greeny guitar.\n",
            "660 I chose this beater just so that I could be more like Bonham.  It has replaced the stock Yamaha beater on my direct drive 9500 pedal.  It is very light and it feels great coming off the batter head.  I have not made any adjustments since swapping out the beater, but I am considering putting a little weight on the beater to make it feel a little more significant.  As far as sound, it's the old school thump.  With my 24\", it rings ever so beautifully.  This may not work so well for hard rock or metal.  Too much bong and not enough bop.\n",
            "661 I bought this for my monoprice les paul copy, as it doesn't come with a pickup selector plate or pickguard. I'm happy with the color and quality, it came with a bunch of screws and a pick. I didn't need the backplates, but they are the right size. For the price I'm happy, as the pickguard alone can run anywhere from $10-20.\n",
            "662 Great little compact mixer. Super versatile. Loving it for my basement studio.\n",
            "663 This is the second ChromaCast hard guitar case that I have purchased and I like both of them! I needed a hard case for my Schecter OMEN-6 guitar. I find myself playing this guitar more and more. I had bought a Schecter hard guitar case from Amazon Warehouse Deals but it didn't fit my guitar (the description said it would). I emailed ChromaCast and they said the CC-EHC case would work. It's a really nice case! It's a good value for the price. I saw the bad reviews for this guitar case and I can tell you that have not had a problem with either one of my cases.\n",
            "664 Purchased after studying the reviews on quality, which is accurate for this mount. It timely arrived. The center mike holder opening is for a much larger microphone than the ATR 2100, that I own. The 2100 indicates 51mm, but that is at the mike area, not the trunk which is much smaller and used for mounting to the shock mount. After researching a replacement in the same price range, I found none. I had some foam pipe insulation for 1/2 inch pvc pipe in the utility room. This is readily available from most any big box hardware store.  I cut the foam about 4\" in length and placed the 2100 in the foam. It fits perfect. I didn't seal the foam, but it is just right and tight in the mount holder. I now have a shock mount that can be used if, and when, I purchase a larger microphone. I have attached a photo. After the image was created, I further trimmed the foam length to match the actual size of the mounting holder opening.  This shock mount is a quality product at a great price.\n",
            "665 This is the worst fitting junk I have ever seen! The pickgaurd is to big and the back plates are to small and the holes do not line up. I could make the pick guard work but it would take time with a drimel to make sure it fit properly without any gaps. The back plates are almost a full 1/4 inch off. waste of time and money.\n",
            "666 Very awesome strap! It looks exponentially cool! Leather ends are supple enough to install to strap buttons easily. Strap itself is really soft, so it doesn't irritate your shoulders and neck while you're playing your guitar. It adjusts pretty easy to your desired length. Buckle is plastic. You may or may not have an issue with that. I personally didn't. It looks amazing, and that's putting it kindly. I've gotten many compliments on it already. Definitely worth the money. As a back story, I was born on the year of the Dragon, so it's only fitting I bought this strap.\n",
            "667 Exactly what I needed, and worked for all different sized instruments. Created the perfect wall piece for my music room. Acoustic, electric, classical and two different size ukuleles. Perfect!\n",
            "668 Great for tuning a lap harp that we got for 5 bucks at a yard sale. The brand in Russian is \"Perepolotchka\" and the back of the harp says \"Made in USSR\". We were so pleased to find this!\n",
            "669 Amazing quality. Stays in tune. Love everything about it!\n",
            "670 This is great sounding at a great price! Is it perfect? No, but it is no less perfect than something costing a lot more and not sounding as good as this pedal. I read one review in which the guy was not satisfied because he said it sounded like \"80's glam rock.\" I totally disagree. If you can play and have a decent amp - you can get a variety of great sounds out of this little box. It seems like so many players like a fuzzy, buzzy type overdrive sound. I prefer a thicker creamy sound and you can dial that up with this pedal. For a mere $35, I was willing to roll the dice - I found a diamond in the rough.\n",
            "671 This is a great cartridge.  It was easy to setup and has a very nice sound.  I also have a Shure m97xe, but I prefer the sound of this one.  Originally, I had issues with it.  The sound was muffled and flat.  To correct it, I reinstalled the stylus until it clicked onto the front.  Sounds great now.\n",
            "672 I bought it open box from online music store.\n",
            "673 <div id=\"video-block-RA7Z7GU9WEPDC\" class=\"a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block\"></div><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"\" value=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/D101XgCvTAS.mp4\" class=\"video-url\"><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"\" value=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91V1FqLj6KS.png\" class=\"video-slate-img-url\">&nbsp;Very surprised about the tone of power of such a small device.  I have also dropped it more than once and it has proven to be durable, as well.  I am actually using it as a practice bass amp and it sounds like playing a bass through a guitar amp, which is acceptable for practice.  I gave it to my guitar player to use and he was very impressed with the improvement in the product, having used other 9 volt practice amps in the past.  Can easily be used to amplify any personal sound needs by using or purchasing a 1/4\" input adapters.  It does not include a power adapter, which would have been a nice addition, so you have to use 9 volt batteries to power your practice sessions.  Watch my demonstration video.\n",
            "674 It's Digitech,if ya don't like it,your an idiot great stuff!,easy,great sounds I've still got my old Rp200-255 300!15years ago!,still going!!\n",
            "675 This pedal have been a good addition to my pedal board.  It did take some time to dial in the right mix and level.  I personally do not use the chorus and vibrato, but it does add a cool later to the sound.  The delay is very good and natural sounding.  This pedal is a great alternative to similar pedals that are much more expensive.\n",
            "676 Extremely impressed with this kit.\n",
            "677 (Review is based on using it with the PYLE PSMRS11 Acoustic Isolation Microphone shield, you can buy it as a package. I bought mine separately) It is one heavy duty mic stand, but I got it for holding up the PYLE PSMRS11 Acoustic Isolation Microphone shield and the damn shield was too heavy to hold in place!  It kept falling over. This mic stand was sold to hold the darn thing but it only works if you place the Isolation Shield in a certain direction (see picture). You must remove the rubber pads that are on the Microphone shield, if you don't you'll find your Isolation shield on the floor! The weight is too heavy for the rubber pads to hold them up (they are glued on). So you have to tighten metal to metal to hold the shield in place. You have to constantly check the tightening supports to make sure they don't pull the support stand down with it! You also have to remove the bottom metal desk supports from the Mic Shield to lighten the load on the Mic Stand. I hope this helps everyone using this for a Mic Shield.\n",
            "678 NICE.. Wish had a little bit more of Low end feel. Super loud.. Does the job.\n",
            "679 definitely a good purchase. nice and comfy for long sessions and the sound is crystal clear\n",
            "680 I have 3 of these now and I like that I can fit any type of guitar on there at the same time, even if they have straps on them. I have other stands that are spaced closer together and even a tremolo bar can get in the way. For those who have complained about no instructions being included, there are two bolts and 4 wheels. If you can't figure that out then maybe putting stuff together isn't your thing.\n",
            "681 The Head piece is a little wobbly but it's overall sturdy. Holds my guitar grimoire just fine and it's on the heavy side .\n",
            "682 Easy as heck to put on, In my opinion better than sperzel. These took literally 10 minutes to put on my  MIM strat.\n",
            "683 If you're looking for mixer to really get busy when it comes to scratching, mixing, or whatever, trust me you need to jump on this mixer right here.\n",
            "684 Did not notice when I ordered this that are no holes pre drilled for the pickup?  When trying to drill prep the product it simply cracked.\n",
            "685 Items work, but the description doesn't match the product. These are not RGBW Led, they were instead RGB.\n",
            "686 This is horrible, poorly made stand. Chinese knock-off quality. Probably the worst quality hardware item I've bought in years, and I own many crappy Dixon cymbal stands. The wingnuts look like stock items in 1950's budget sets. The main tube OD is MAYBE 1/2\". Just atrocious. If I were Mapex, I wouldn't put my name on this. I'd return it, but I'm only using it for a practice pad, so I guess it will do. Spend another $20 and get something decent.\n",
            "687 This is for my son in his rehearsal room and they are perfect! Great quality, arrived within a few days and the price you cant beat!\n",
            "688 Not bad at all for the price.  Cheaper on Amazon than ebay.  Installation was straight forward after watching some youtube videos.  I would watch out for the EXACT shape when cutting the holes in the body.  The larger piece has a couple of 'clipped' corners that need to be left on the body for the screws to grab.  Sounds great and the tuner is accurate.\n",
            "689 This is not Fretboard Oil Cleaner. It is pure magic! If you love your guitars and basses, you will purchase this immediately and start treating them with the love and care they deserve. It is sooooo easy to use, and a little goes a very long way. I recently worked on a mid '60s Harmony Rocket and the fretboard was, well, disgusting. I have included some before and after pics of the fretboard after crowning and polishing the frets and then cleaning it using Nomad. Judge for yourself.\n",
            "690 I love this pickguard, looks so cool on my red Telecaster, matches all the other chrome hardware, made of metal and does NOT scratch! Every one that sees my Telecaster loves it! Thanks! Good price also, saw several other sellers with this product, this seller had the best price by far! Packaged VERY well and delivered in a timely manner!\n",
            "691 I think this is good, the range of height is too short for the price. You can get a larger and heaviest for $1 or $2 more\n",
            "692 I originally installed these on my semi-hollow body Gretch D6128 Thunderbass in an attempt to cut down on the string and fret noise I was getting with conventional strings.\n",
            "693 Stretch them strings !\n",
            "694 I was able to install my new guitar hanger easily. I found a stud exactly where I wanted to install it, and I predrilled the holes to accommodate the two long wood screws; drywall anchors are included in the package.\n",
            "695 This bridge is beyond iconic and needed for any Telecaster build. Looks beautiful on any body that you put it on!\n",
            "696 But don't let that deter you. That just means it will break-in that much more quickly. My favorite strap is not padded in any way, like this strap, but a little wider. I use this on a Telecaster and it looks nice and matches well with the color scheme of the guitar.

The strap is made in Canada from decent quality leather(not bonded) and the gold Fender logo is understated, yet classy. It's a classic strap from Fender. What else is there to say?\n",
            "697 I purchased these for a Cigar Box Guitar, they work great for that purpose.  I have no complaints.\n",
            "698 The mixer has good build. Knobs, and sliders are smooth. Buttons click with no crackling. It is quite.. no hiss. (Unless turn pre-amps wide open). I'm not a big fan of RCA jacks..but it is portable. Best pick compared to other battery powered mixers IMO. Mixer is on top/left of pedalboard in the pics. I had to used RCA right angle adapters so would fit in the pedalboard case.\n",
            "699 This case was bought for my Epiphone Les Paul Black Beauty 3 which fits inside pretty well, although there is a little wiggle room. The case appears to be built well, however, the case lid is misaligned with the base section when closed shut. The lid should overlap the bottom case similar to how a shoe box lid fits on top of its box. The misalignment creates an odd gap which is only noticeable upon close inspection. I have a similar Epiphone case for my Sheraton and that case closes properly like my shoe box example. So beware production quality may not be consistant and could vary on a case to case basis (I couldn't resist that pun).\n",
            "700 We opened the case and immediately saw the bow had strings visibly hanging off of it.  When we turned the latch to remove the bow to inspect it, we could see that several strings were caught in the the latch.  It took several minutes to carefully extracate it from the latch without breaking even more strings. Not sure if this was previously used and returned as new or just carelessly packed.  We haven't tuned it yet and will update our review on the actual violin later.  At this point, I am concerned.\n",
            "701 Fit my 1999 Taylor 414CE with only minor thinning.  Had to adjust for action height, of course.  Was twice the height it needed to be.  Works well.  Intonation is solid.  Sounds fine.  Noticeably more high end sparkle in the treble strings.\n",
            "702 My Les Paul guitar fits nicely in this gig bag, so does my stratocaster, it has 3 large zip up storage compartments for picks, tuners, sheet music, cords, strings, and more. Its nicely made and is rather protective for the guitar, the material isn't really soft so beware guitar scratches, but this gig bag is very nice, I'd recommend it to anyone needing a good quality gig bag.\n",
            "703 I cannot say enough good things about this particular guitar strap. I have several Walker & Williams straps and not a one of them is a loser, but when I pulled this out of the packaging yesterday, I immediately fell in love with it. Buttery smooth, real leather smell, nice stitching - just an overall quality piece of work. Looks beautiful on my Hagstrom. Couldn't be happier.\n",
            "704 This is a great stereo reverb with plenty of control to get the sounds I want. The toneprint is a great feature to check out the settings from some great artists. I am completely satisfied with the features and sound of this pedal and highly recommend it!\n",
            "705 You know, for a low-cost item, these do a pretty good job.  We are using them for filler lights to keep shadows down on the stage. My friend has an earlier version that does not include the fans and he had issues with them flickering due to overheating.  With the fans added, although noisy, it seems to eliminate the flickering issue.\n",
            "706 This kit is incredible !!  The quality is great for the investment.  I have been playing a Ludwig kit that is ok, but these are really higher quality. The finish and hardware are very nice, and maple is a plus also.\n",
            "707 Pretty simple perfect fit a little thicker than the original used it for a vintage modified 70s squire strat to give it an even more classic look. It was very easy to put on just watch a youtube video youll be fine. The black backplate adds a nice touch i have silver and black hardware so that worked out. I felt that the screws they gave me weren't as good as my originals. I did not use them. I think this product is a bit overpriced but thats probably because its laser etched. Adds a nice touch without seeming like you are trying to pass your guitar off for something more expensive. Here are some pictures.\n",
            "708 Can't say they look exactly like what's in the picture, especially since they don't have that gold ring around the center. However they're still perfectly usable, cheap, and still look neat on the guitar\n",
            "709 Perfect! Go get it don't delay, quick and easy install...........\n",
            "710 I have a 35 scale bass so I figured these strings would seem fitting. Well, I was wrong and forgot to account that my strings don't get feed through the bridge but get feed through the backside. The tapered part of the stings sit between the 1st fret and nut and causes it to buzz as seen in my photos. If you have a bass set up like mine, go with Ernie Balls.\n",
            "711 Installed these in my Ibanez  AS53 with no problem.  Probably not the application intended by the mfg, as they are intended to replicate active metal pickups. The Neck pickup is pretty dark, and lacks volume and clarity. The bridge pickup is louder, and brighter than the neck. I've had both better, and worse pickups... these are just alright. If I had it to do all over again, I probably would have just left the stock pickups in the guitar. It's not worth sending back, as the product does actually work, and tone is such a personal and subjective thing. I'm rating three stars as a neutral rating.\n",
            "712 Like these a lot. Easy install. Be sure to go to graphtech website and follow their instructions on how to check which model fits in your bridge, pro tip: glossy finishes can help you see the bottom side of your bridge without taking it off or using a little specialty mirror tool. Did I mention the things look damn sexy?\n",
            "713 Great material and very easy to work with. I cut this on my band saw with no issue and the surface cleans up very nice after cutting.\n",
            "714 A few weeks ago I bought the WP (white pearl) stickers which I really liked although I even said in my review that they have a slightly gray or silver cast to them. I just got another set, this time the AWP (aged white pearl) set and I'm glad I did. Tbhey do NOT look like stickers and you really can't tell unless you get your nose right on them. These actually look like aged pearl. They look freakin real. Check the image, it shows the WP set on the left and the AWP on the right. The pics aren't too good but good enough that you can see the difference..\n",
            "715 I have only had this pedal a few hours. It does what they say, maybe better than they say. I ran it through its paces with my Telecaster and was amazed. It can sound like the very costly Lesley pedals that go for near $400 but all that for only $50. I am happy, only 4 stars because I don't trust Behringer. I never had any of their stuff last that long.\n",
            "716 Excellent quality for the price. Can be trimmed to fit smaller speakers. I put two of them under my center channel on my home theater.\n",
            "717 Gibraltar makes good stuff...really good. But I have to return it as the inside diameter of the utility side of the bracket is 1 3/8 fully closed.\n",
            "718 I bought this bass to split time as my primary bass with my Dean Edge. This might be winning me over. The bass boost is outstanding. The active pickups really allow you to adjust to the sound you want. I recommend this for anyone. If you're a beginner  like I was not too long ago, it's an excellent bass to start with. If you're on tour and/or music is making you money, this bass will be beatiful on stage. The color is a bit darker than in the picture. But, all around, this is a great buy.\n",
            "719 I picked this up to help complete an overhaul of my '78 strat. Everything lined up perfectly, and this product was every bit as high quality as the original. Took just over 2 weeks to arrive (which was about what I was expecting). Very pleased with everything.\n",
            "720 The product was well packaged, and looks great right out of the box. The keys are full sized, and the keyboard is light without feeling cheap.\n",
            "721 After much online shopping, and 20 years of using traditional stands, I needed something with easier access and greater stability than the standard 3 leg stands. I had six guitars in stands, and this Hercules unit had the best reviews. The box arrived in great shape, and I pulled out the stand and popped it open and it was ready to go. Included was additional parts to add a 6th guitar to the stand, which I needed. Very easy to configure the spacing, and load the guitars, stable. Now it is easy for me to grab a guitar to play and then put away. I have an acoustic, 3 electrics, a semi-hollow body electric (E335 style), and a bass. Highly recommended.\n",
            "722 Well built.  Nice carrying case.  Comes with plenty of hook and loop.  I'd recommend getting some hook and loop cable ties instead of the plastic ones included.  The dimensions make the most sense of the different brand large boards that I looked at.  See pic for reference.\n",
            "723 I like em! Got a 3-pack, and now my cheap guitars don't have to sit on the floor. Easy to assemble, pretty sturdy. Almost knocked one over, and it righted itself impressively.\n",
            "724 Absolutely love it. Does exactly what I need it to do with utmost confidence. I can even shove 6 guitars, acoustic or electric IN CASES with this rack. Is it expensive? Yes, but is it worth it? Many times over.\n",
            "725 Hold tune ok, but string clamps loosen while tuning.\n",
            "726 At first, this would not work with the AT2020 USB+  microphone.  The pole is too thick to screw into the mount that comes with the mic.\n",
            "727 iT WOULD BE EASY TO BLAME THE GUITAR BUT sOME OF MY FELLOW MUSIANS HAVE TRIED IT WITH THERE GUITAR ANS SAME THING.. MOST PRO-NOUNCED ON THE HIGHEST STRINGS.. ALL THE STRINGS HAVE THE SAME VOLUME OR DYNAMICS. WHETHER I PLAY MY 335 OR MY SOUTHWESTERN. ACOUSTIC. THIS IS IMPORTANT TO ME AS I BUSK SOLO.\n",
            "728 awesome! i had the old mini, but this orientation had more useful space! pictured here is my board.\n",
            "729 Several items broken upon arrival. The fix was me gigging it up and not their fix. Warranty what warranty? Spend your money elsewhere. Very dissatisfied and disappointing to say the least. I've gotten better deals and service off Craigslist\n",
            "730 Sticks on great. It also holds on extremely tight. And when i take it of my finish is perfect\n",
            "731 Works & sounds beautifully. Would recommend this to anybody!\n",
            "732 VERSATILITY/MULTIPLAYER MIC-RECORDER\n",
            "733 It's a great deal, very good product for the money, but you need to be aware that your instrument (especially acoustics) will need to have the adjustable center arm raised considerably in order to keep the headstocks from bumping. The higher you raise it, the farther apart the headstocks will be BUT the higher you raise it the less backward tilt of the guitars. Less tilt, less stability, so be sure to use the attached neck holders. The attached photo shows two full size acoustics with the center arm about 80% raised and the headstocks are about an inch apart. Any lower and they touch.\n",
            "734 Amazon's product states that this shock mount fits 43 to 50mm diameter mics. It does not. It will not even fit my MXL V69XM which specs out at 47 mm diameter. See the photos ... it does not fit even with a white-knuckle effort to open the jaws. I ordered three through Amazon and none of them came in a Neewer box that was shown. Grossly under-size!\n",
            "735 Great Quality, adjustable tension. Well made.\n",
            "736 These go wonderfully with my Zakk Wylde Les Paul Custom Plus Grail. Been using Dunlop Straploks for years. They definitely take a beating. Granted I am not doing around the worlds and jumping around stage like a coke head, that behavior will destroy nearly any product, especially with wood and small screws. However, they definitely withstand some metal stage presence. Had some issues with seating but hats user error. Push the button and ensure it is fully seated and protect your guitar and investment. Easy day.\n",
            "737 Works perfectly for my ukuleles and guitars. Simple to use. Instant on and off. Perfect tuner!\n",
            "738 I bought a set of these to upgrade my Kona K1ETRD, a vast improvement over the old ones, now it stays in tune better and they're very smooth, looks nice too!\n",
            "739 This desk stand is small enough to easily fit inside my field bag, doesn't weigh much, and does its job effectively. Although it is small, it is still able to sturdily hold my RODE NTG2 microphone without danger of tipping over. Clipping the long microphone to the stand at the very end of the shotgun is a little precarious but I have made it work. It probably helps that the rode screw-on is very heavy, allowing the center of balance to be closer to the center of the stand.\n",
            "740 a little bit shorter than expected but pretty good\n",
            "741 Actually surprised. I originally intended to use this as a low gain type pedal but when I unintentionally cascades this into my Rat 2 pedal, a magical thing happened. This guy opened up the mids in the rat pedal. I am running the rat at 18volts with excellent results. This drive pedal is set at gain 2 and cascading into the rat pedal. Excellent! Immediately earning a prized spot on my board.\n",
            "742 I love the trashiness of this China! Hard to believe it's only a 12inch but it's sounds pretty powerful. I like it! Get one.\n",
            "743 Worked perfect for what I needed them for!!!!\n",
            "744 Doesn't conform to my Taylor 110 very well, causing lower strings to not push down enough and be muted or buzz. Tried readjusting 20 different ways to no luck. Been playing this guitar with capos for 12 years, never had a problem before.\n",
            "745 This is a basic pedal for vocal enhancements, but it lacks in the department of effects and customization. It would have been nice to have more effects and greater control over their parameters.\n",
            "746 Works perfectly with nylon flamenco and classical guitars. Use it in studio, on stage, never failed, great battery life, bright, sensitive.\n",
            "747 it's more on toy side than on instrument side, and made in Indonesia.\n",
            "748 Great little pedal. Wonderful brand. Well built equipment with quality. The housing feels solid and well manufactured. With sound in mind it has a fantastic beautiful depth to it. As a guitarist with roots in rock, grunge and metal it can be a versatile sound with the right mixture. Combined with a marshall tube dc40 and it will not leave you unhappy.\n",
            "749 This was a gift from my sister and brother in law for babysitting there kids until school start. I have to say this is an Amazing Guitar. For 200$ it's worth the buy and if your new to 7 string guitars you'll love it. Well shipped and a well made guitar. I couldn't be any more happier with the White looks so sick.\n",
            "750 For the price, this is awesome. The heel is larger than a standard Fender neck. If you're building the body, just make a template off the neck itself. The nut is cheap plastic. Buzz at high E 5th fret was fixed just by tapping lightly on the fret with a small hammer. Fret ends are sharp but not dangerous. Not too fat, nor thin. Truss rod turned free and easy.\n",
            "751 These are alot better than the Mahalo felt picks I've been using on my ukuleles. The Mahalos are soft, fat and flat, these are stiff, thinner and tapered, meaning they're easier to hold and play with and I get sharper sound. The 12 I got should last for quite some time, the Mahalos are showing more wear. Probably everyone should get some felt picks, very useful and alot of fun; these are really good ones.\n",
            "752 This braided cable is one of the nicest I've ever used that was under $50. The sound is crisp and not distorted with no buzz or ground hum, even jumping on the cable did not produce any undesired sound bleed. The ends are gold plated for increased connectivity and the ends are well shielded with a quality heat shield tubing covering the wire connections. the end covers are well threaded and do not loosen themselves after use. I have been playing for 15 years now both live and studio and haven't found cables this nice that did not have a hefty price tag. I plan to pick up a few more of these in different lengths to replace some others I've used i like them that much. I did receive this product at a discount in return for a fair unbiased opinion. If my review was helpful to you please click the yes button.\n",
            "753 As with other dean guitars this does not disappoint. Finish is perfect at least on mine. Grover tuners that stay in tune(my gibson sg's???).\n",

            "755 Let Me Start Of By Saying That This Is My First New Drum Set In 10 Years, And It Totally Rocks,It Is A Great Sounding Set! (Wouldn't Hurt To Upgrade Heads And Cymbals) But The Current Ones Will Hold Over, Until I Can Get Upgrades Other Than That I Am Very Happy With This Set It Is An Excellent Upgrade From My Old One And Comes Through 100% Best Purchase Made! (Silver Snare Drum Is My Own) Not To Confuse It With The Set.\n",
            "756 Super light weight and flexible, great for live shows!\n",
            "757 I have screwed the base as tight as I can get it, but the weight of my speakers (powered EV15's 2 way) causes the tripod to start to fold up.\n",
            "758 amazing! you just need it! and more than one\n",
            "759 Very poor quality. Two of the pegs are missing part of or all insert. Back they go. Wouldn't waste your time or money on these.\n",
            "760 You can find cheaper power supply units, but they tend to add noise.  Thanks to Amazon's return policy, I was able to try out a couple units.  The MXR M238 unit worked great and is very quiet.  Pedals can be very picky and I had trouble with chaining some of the pedals together.  The MXR pedal was the best option for me, it had enough sockets and the size of the unit worked great for my board.\n",
            "761 I recently started using very light guage carbon strings (E1 is .024 inches) and E1 and B needed double knots (triple knots on E1)  to keep them tied and tuned.  Even then sometimes E1 would come loose.  A friend told me about string ties and suggested they might solve the problem. I looked around at the various tie systems available and I bought the Diamond Secure Classical Guitar String Ties because I liked the size. The result was what I needed; B and E1 don't slip with the ties and they stay in tune. I did a double loop with E1 as suggested in the instructions, just to be sure. I was concerned about the appearance of the Ties, but I am satisfied with the look. The Ties are small and have an unobtrusive,  neat appearance.  The attached picture shows my first effort with the Ties. In terms of sound or effect on the guitar I don't hear any difference, but the Ties do simplify the process of tying on strings.\n",
            "762 Excellent budget 7 string , Had to touch up the fret work a bit and tighten down some of the screws but other than that it was perfect . Replaced the original strings with 11-64 for A standard tuning . i wasn't sure if i was getting 22 or 24 frets on the guitar as it said both in the description but it did come with 24 frets . Have been playing Korn and trivium covers so far and its perfect for it . Stock ESP pups are not to bad , decent tone , i'm using a peavy 6505+ amp .\n",
            "763 Thus should be a 5 star review, but sadly, it's only a 3. I bought a cymbal off of eBay that was a mess. I got it for next to nothing and figured I would clean it up. Cleaner sure worked well and then THANKFULLY I read to not use on the Letters. Holy cow I was this close to cleaning up those areas when thankfully someone called me and I read the entire bottle to the very end.\n",
            "764 I got this for my Ibanez EW20ASE.... the pin on the back of the body by the neck was too far recessed to get the rigid plastic ratched clasp on it.... I was mad for about 10 seconds. Great quality strap, looks fantastic, feels great to the hand and the locks are nothing to sneeze at, they really lock to your pins. So, I took it and put it on my Ibanez AS93 (a fairly heavy guitar for being semi-hollow) and they fit, perfectly. I had just done a string change and spent a little over an hour playing and breaking the strings in, this strap is super comfy (especially for not being padded). The material is somewhere between satin and a seatbelt with a cool stitched \"xxx/diamond\" design (that's my words, not Planet Waves). Absolutely love it and VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND for use with any guitar that doesn't have recessed strap pins) A++++++\n",
            "765 Oh my word I am sold I love my AT2100 which Ive used for 5+ years for podcasting and YouTube BUT this thing is amazing for my current use case. Im using it as a boom above my head for YouTube videos. Wow! At about 2-3 feet away it is perfect. Very rich sound for my bassy voice. I recommend this to anyone who wants a budget mic with awesome sound.\n",
            "766 I've got a five person band for our Hawaiian performing arts group. These headsets make for even audio. No fading in and out as a singer moves closer or farther away from the mic, or turns her face to the right or left. They use the Shure SM58 pick-ups which are time proven. These headsets are especially good when I want to record a live performance. Anyone want to buy my stick mics and stands?\n",
            "767 I ordered this case to travel to Brazil with my 335. Fits perfectly as its not an actual Gibson 335 so I was a little worried at first however when it arrived and I placed the instrument inside I was very pleased!\n",
            "768 For what it is, it is great. Perfect for practice.  Past my days of playing live, now it is just for pleasure.  This amp delivers for that.  Keeps the noise down for others, delivers great sound, takes up almost zero space. Great buy.\n",
            "769 The Amazon advertised pictures of this item is a Fender FTE3 pre amp. The description says it's a Fishman Isys III type. I googled it and found out there's two version of pre amp type of this T Bucket 300 CE series. The one I got today is a Fishman type pre amp which is for me much better that FTE3. Out of the box, I fell inlove with the color and design. Mine is a 3 tone sunburst. The action is just right for me. The tone/sound is awesome. I hooked it up in my Vox amp and I have to say this thing really rocks. Of course you can get a better sounding acoustic/electric guitar out there for a very much expensive price. I'm a family man with two kids and I am not gonna spend a thousand bucks just for a hobby. Amplified or not I love the tone of this baby. For it's appearance, sound quality, and of course THE PRICE, I'm giving it a five stars.\n",
            "770 Awesome. Quite an upgrade for me after only owning cheapo guitar stands all my life. This baby is thick, sturdy, and very difficult to tip over. One thing that's not mentioned anywhere: these stands carry a LIFETIME WARRANTY.\n",
            "771 What I ordered was MSP6100 SP Lifespan 80/20. But what I got was a package of 7050SW with a sticker on the backside reading 6100\n",
            "772 Perfect RGB 86 LED PAR light! Very bright, light weight, sturdy! Fitting well in my music studio set up! I'm gonna order 3 more! (My favorite color is blue:)\n",
            "773 The bag is snug, but works well and has excellent padding for transportation.\n",
            "774 Blends beautifully with the chrome tonearm, and includes the 4g weight which is easily removed.  I am using in conjunction with an Ortofon 2M Red on a 1200Mk2.  Excellent results.  Somehow, although the output level is rated the same between my previous setup (Concorde cartridge with Ortofon Night Club stylus, 5mV spec), I am now getting a proper output level through my preamp, whereas the previous cartridge/stylus was at at least 6dB lower.  Weird.  Tried two different model stylii on the other headshell, another headshell altogether, and they both gave the same result.\n",
            "775 These fit my Schaller strap lock equipped straps perfectly.  Nice chrome coating.  The supplied screws looked a little thin, so I mounted the strap buttons with stainless steel #6 screws.  I'd buy these again for my next project.\n",
            "776 I purchased these stands to hold my Yamaha HS5's. These stands are really well made..heavy and have a nice look to them. I really like the triangle base as it makes it easy for them to fit in the corners of my room. They have locking pins that are great for keeping the stands at the height that you set. They also have some type of rubber feet that helps with leveling the stand. These are pretty impressive. The only thing that I don't like is that the platform that the speakers sit on are a bit larger than i'd like...but this is more my fault for not reading the dimensions. Other than that, I highly recommend these.\n",
            "777 It's built solidly but the tolerances and alignment of the various holes leave a lot to be desired, you have to be somewhat forceful in a few instances in order to get it to stay together straight. Once that was taken care of, there's really nothing to complain about, the unit is reasonably sturdy (don't jump on it, but it will hold your instruments no problem) and it's working very well for me. How well? Look at the picture!\n",
            "778 This is an excellent little stand.  The adjustment for angle is easy to do, and the construction is robust. Quite roadworthy!  It fits my Mesa-Boogie Subway Rocket perfectly, and holds it at just the right angle to make the most of my little amp.  The Boogie is no lightweight either. It is a handbuilt, all tube point-to-point American-Made amp in a robust case.\n",
            "779 This is a great Les Paul like guitar for the novice player. Very minimum setup was needed...6th string buzzed a little. Everyone loves the look. Fun to play at a very affordable price.\n",
            "780 I use this with the Zoom G3n and it works well as an expression pedal. Good value, solid build quality, so far so good.\n",
            "781 Well maybe not \"better\", different but on the same level of awesome sound. I almost want to lie and say they suck so nobody else gets them... The sound is so round and full I couldn't believe it. I started building my own guitars and I will buy more of those soon. Put three on my home-made strat,\n",
            "782 Perfect slide if you want more control over patterns and fingering as you play. The finger you use the slide on can bend and is free to do work as well! Plus the brass keeps it nice and chunky. Ive got small hands for a guy, I wear small to medium gloves, size 8-9 ring finger so based on the product  description I figured this would fit perfectly on my middle finger so I could do slide and chord mixtures. Wont go over my second knuckle on my middle finger which should be around a size 10-11. After trying tons of glass, chrome, and brass full slides, I found this small slide to be perfect for what I play.\n",
            "783 This is very best for me. Soft and safe.\n",
            "784 Well built, all metal construction, It's capable of holding 6 and possibly 7 smaller mics if you use the center mounting hole that goes over the mic stand, you can use a mic clip to hold the bar instead of the washer / nut. I use it to hold 4 large diaphragm condenser mics with shock mounts. It keeps me from having to swap mics for different vocalists when recording.  I just position the pop filter in front of the mic that is being used and mute the unused ones.  Sometimes I'll actually leave the other mics on and record the simultaneous vocal takes across several mics to separate tracks. This gives me several \"flavors\" to add effects to without having the vocalist do individual takes on different mics.  It saves a lot of time when choosing a mic for a particular vocalist.\n",

            "788 Looks great! Replaced the stock neck plate on my Squier standard telecaster.\n",
            "789 I like this pedal very much so far. My favorite pedal was a Joyo and it didn't last long. It's in my junk pile. I hate the for the money thing. This delay pedal does a lot more than most one trick ponys out there. Money when you get into Chinese stuff is a gamble, I hope I get some time out of this Joyo because it just that great.\n",
            "790 Great controller. The sound and build quality are very good. Balanced outputs, aux, 4 channels of control, huge responsive jog wheels. This controller also has VU meters for every single channel which is really hard to find at this price point. The low and high pass filters have a nice whisp to them. The only thing I don't like are the feel of the performance pads. They are not pads but more like triggers. Don't get me wrong, they work fine and are responsive but they do not feel like the pads that are on the pioneer ddj for example. They are not velocity pads. Other than that this thing is a beast and well worth the money.\n",
            "791 The price is to good to be true! It blew after light use of 2 years maybe 4 times a year! Started smoking all sound went out and ruined the event! Don't  waste  your money on something that will just blow after light use at very low volumes!\n",

Here's a few pics from the 2016  GABF festival in Denver...\n",
            "793 I ordered the RODE Podcaster and needed a shockmount that would work with it on the first try. I could have found a cheaper third party solution, but to be honest I wanted my Mic to have the products that were designed for it. That's why I went with the PSM1. It's got a perfect fit for the Podcaster and Procaster mic's. No real complaints from it thus far.\n",
            "794 I purchased this to protect my Jim Dandy guitar when I'm out and about.  It is a parlor sized guitar and needed a fairly snug fit - a regular dread bag was just WAY too big.\n",
            "795 Fits great but the only complaint I have is that the tremolo springs are cheap quality and so is the block that attaches to the bridge. I took it off and put my own on. When you do that though, the wammy bar won't fit.\n",
            "796 This tape worked great for my latest build. Adhesive is strong and the tape accepted solder well with no issues. It's thin enough to form inside cavities well and installation is easy. I would recommend peeling back just enough backing to start one end and then remove the rest as you go. Since the product comes in a pill bottle, it's formed in a tight circle so, if you just hold one end and remove all the backing, it will recoil and stick to itself. Great product!\n",
            "797 Overall, this neck is a good deal. It's straight, level and the wood has nice grain. Everything seems to intonate correctly. It fit my VM Squire Telecaster neck pocket perfectly. I had to file 7 frets to level it, but I guessed that going in.\n",
            "798 This pickup has a great, traditional, single coil strat sound. I'm really pleased with the sweet clear tone this delivers. You can make it scream with your amp setting if that's what you want. It's really great looking, too! I had no issues at all with the soldering connections, and the volume and tone pots work well as does the jack. I used this on a cigar box guitar build, and I love the tone! This homemade CBG sounds like a legitimate strat. I would definitely use this pickup again in the future, and I have no doubt it would sound good to swap out the pups on a cheapo commercial strat with these. My only complaint, and it's a small one, is that the knobs included had a tiny bit of smearing on the gold paint. It's not a big deal because many pups don't include knobs at all, and there are so many knob options available at very affordable prices. I actually used the knobs anyway, so I'm not going to knock a star off for that. The tone and looks of the pickup are fantastic at this price!\n",

            "808 Very high quality pickguard material at a great price. I make thinline partscasters and like to change the control positions from the \"stock\" location so I have to manufacture my own pickguards.\n",
            "809 These picks not only look good the are comfortable to use. The seem to have a rounded valley which leaves a raised edged. This helps to keep your finger on the pick and doesn't allow it to move around. In the close up picture you can see a slight curvature. This is the first time I have used these picks. I don't know how they will last but I will have fun finding out. It's a pick. You use it on a guitar. It's not complicated. I think its a very personal choice. But I have really enjoyed using these so far.\n",
            "810 What luck that I received Dad's mandolin back from the luthier at the same time I was offered a trial of this mandolin strap in the Vine program!\n",
            "811 I wasn't able to begin to get this item onto my Shure SM58 without tearing it.  Other reviewers have regarded the tight fit as a feature, but to me it it a big defect.  I take the windscreen on and off as conditions dictate, so I don't want to have a fight on my hands every time I need to make a change.  The picture shows a comparison of a Shure windscreen and this item (note the tear on the right one.\n",
            "812 I've been using this with my new Zoom H1n since I got it, and often times in very windy settings (the beach in particular). This works marvelously, as expected. The fit is perfect and the elastic has just the right about of grab. Other than it being quite large on my little recorder (my kids refer to it as my \"chinchilla\"), it works like a champ at muffling wind noise.\n",
            "813 I used to own a Boss CS-3. This pedal is almost as good for less than 1/2 the price and footprint.\n",
            "814 Good product, though in the 15 I bought there were slight inconsistencies in the angle lock mechanism. It seems the button latch is a little too low to click into place consistently on some of them, but it doesn't affect them in any real way unless you're the type who uses a protractor to angle your instruments just so. Also, if you have smaller headstocks on your guitars or basses, you'll probably need to adjust the width of the holder with channel-locks or something similar that can squeeze the sides together. Still, they look good, even better when mounted on a piece of stained pine, and they hold my guitars and basses nicely.\n",
            "815 Easier to install than I thought! Was a little skeptical because of some reviews... but I guess they were from people who can't follow instructions.... I used the little stick provided and was done in less than 10mins!  Love it!\n",
            "816 I can't see how you could get a better product for the money. This thing is fantastic. The size, man, Donner is really on to something with this Nano design. Around the height of a playing card and half the width. It's tiny but still fully functional for a basic delay/falloff pedal. The tone quality of my Chinese humbuckers through the pedal is great even if I put a distorted signal through it, and the range of adjustment is sure to add some flair to just about any playing style. Build quality is spot on, the plugs are solid, and the quality of the stomp switch would feel right at home on a $100 pedal.\n",
            "817 kinda flimsy but oit does the job\n",
            "818 This is a first blush review and might not be helpful to readers outside of the United States.  I have plugged a variety of pedals into the JP-02 and all powered-up as expected.  The AC plug that goes into the wall or power strip is not designed for standard outlets found in the United States.  While this is not an inherent flaw, it is not stated clearly enough in the item description and I do not believe it can be seen in the photos.  JOYO does include a 2-prong adapter for use in the United States.  The adapter is much smaller than the power supply itself, which leaves the bottom of the power supply resting 1-5/8\" away from the outlet (see attached photo).  There simply doesn't seem to be enough surface contact between the base of the power supply and the outlet.  A few trips over the power cord could easily compromise the integrity of the adapter, AC plug and/or your outlet.  I have not yet decided whether or not to keep this.\n",

            "826 So out of all the Tube Screamers I've had, this is the first to say \"Maxon\" on the outside. I have a TS9DX and TS9 that were made for Ibanez by Maxon in the 90's that were modded to 808 spec, and this pedal sounds dead-on to that sound.\n",
            "827 I was impressed by the quality and presentation of the packaging. It does mute my cello but it does not fit on my bridge properly. It won't go down all the way. It doesn't sound too great. I wish I had bought a rubber  mute instead.\n",
            "828 I got mine at a music store, not here, but wanted to give a review. First, it is a $40 uke... so people need to keep this in mind. I got it to play a campfires,  the beach, by my hot tub, etc. I am not expecting  it to sound like wood. Given that, I am very pleased. It is a great novelty item. People say theirs does not stay in tune, but mine does.  I can hang it on the wall and not touch it for several months. It  is still pretty much in tune, with some minor adjustment. But I would expect that from a wooden or more expensive one as well.  I added some miniature lights off Amazon and it certainly serves its purpose.  Enough light to see if I want to play in the dark, and also can be festive as well.  I have never regretted purchasing this.\n",
            "829 Stunned at how clear and full the audio was.  Very easy to use with my iPhone and a free audio recording app (Voice Record).  Then just push the result up to Dropbox.\n",

            "832 It worked well for about a month, and then broke too much to use.\n",
            "833 I like! I'm using the stomp thru a cheap reverb into a 15w bass amp. Going straight, not too impressive but, when ya lightly process the signal, it really pops! I used shelf liner to keep in from moving around when I play. Great for the price!\n",
            "834 Had to drill into my headstock. Needs 2 holes per tree because of the mounting peg. Use a ruler and a 1/16 drillbit and you'll be fine. I recommend installing with the strings on so you can set them properly.\n",
            "835 Not much to say here - they're knobs. They look good, are well made and fit perfectly on the CTS pots in my guitar.\n",
            "836 I have the 7 guitar version of this same stand (which costs less).  As I said in that review, put it together loosely, then, if all is good, tighten it down.  The instructions are OK, just make sure that you read them and identify all the parts (some look alike but are slightly different).  Poor reviews must be by the mechanically challenged.  You get what you pay for - even though the bigger stand costs less - but it works fine.  I have some very expensive instruments in mine with no worries.\n",
            "837 Prefect case for what I have . Thanx Amazon\n",
            "838 I have a newer model build without the coveted LM308 chip so I can't comment or compare it to that but in certain settings it does sound great.  I don't use this as a primary distortion but rather as one of many and I frequently use it in tandem with my DS-1 or Big Muff Pi. I use it to make already distorted sounds even louder and more dirty. The Filter knob should not even have the option of going all the way clockwise. To me, it sounds like piss if you do that.\n",
            "839 These stands are excellent. They are well built and easy to assemble. they come with an Allen wrench and that is the only tool needed. The stand has a nice design when it comes to the base. There are 3 soft rubber pads that come on the stand. They also give you 3 pointed metal spikes that you can put on, which is perfect if placing on a rug. The spikes are adjustable so you can get set for the rug height and get the stand perfectly level. I put a pair of JBL monitor speakers (LSR305) on this stand for my Yamaha piano DGX-650B. See attached pictures. The stands look like they were made to go with this piano.\n",
            "840 I just wanted to say that the Fender Vintage Noiseless Pickups were a great upgrade to my 2012 Fender Standard Stratocaster.  They provide a much cleaner, bell-like tone compared to the factory-fitted pickups.  The factory pickups are actually great for gritty blues and rock, but my playing is mostly clean, so I prefer the sound of the Vintage Noiseless.  Also, the package I got had the updated wiring diagram (correct!) - the only issue is that is didn't show how to connect the output jack hot wire, but it is shown on the wiring diagram from Fender's website (for the American Deluxe Stratocaster).  I installed the new pots, capacitors, resistor that came in the package and this gave me the cleanest, brightest tone.  If you want a warmer tone, you can probably skip doing this.\n",
            "841 I traded for a TMB100 in sea foam green recently and I was pleased with the construction. The wiring is good. After I set it up everything was great. My only complaint is that I had the bass only 24 hrs before the Tone/Bass knob snapped off in my hand, right at the base as I was adjusting the tone, rendering them useless and stuck in their current configuration. I didn't really think I was cranking it that hard. Now I have to buy a $60 preamp knob before my next show and be terrified that I'm gonna snap it off again. tldr: Great guitar. Needs a setup. Be careful with the specific expensive knobs.\n",
            "842 Cool little portable sound amplifier, for when you just got to make noise without waking the neighborhood! Very light, hope it's impact resistant so I can stuff it in a back pack with other goodies. I'm using it for harmonica, slide guitar, or as a powered speaker for my media players. The sound is decent and the battery seem to last long enough. I am happy with this purchase. Way to go Danelectro!\n",
            "843 Nice solid springs and defeinitely more silent. Easy installation and the black looks cool.\n",
            "844 nan\n",
            "845 Every guitarist must have one of these for a dash an play gig. Packed and ready to go. More good sounds than you will ever use in a life time and I also own and use the Eleven Rack and Fractal Audio's Axe-FXII. Check me out at You Tube user/loowood2 or Google LooWood\n",
            "846 Worked for maybe 30 minutes then it died and never came back on. Used standard pedal power supply to power it. What I heard sounded good, but its internals died so quickly. Tried batteries, and other power supplie afterwards. Nothing worked. Refunded and got a Dr. Scientist Pedal and have been amazed.\n",
            "847 Man. No words can not be said. I have a Catalina Maple drum set. Once I placed this head on there and that first hit. It sound like a cannon. Perfect sound. It make you want to play all day. Made me want to start dancing.\n",
            "848 This is my second ukulele. I recieved this as a Christmas gift and I love it. It has very nice strings and has like mother of pearl tuning pegs. With my first uke I had trouble with the strings being hard to tune but right when I got this I tuned within 30 seconds and started playing. Also it comes with a chord chart and songs and a case.\n",
            "849 Exactly what I needed! The wall mounts were extremely inexpensive, are nothing super fancy because I just needed something to hold my stuff to the wall, not to look super expensive and fancy, and work perfectly well. I have three guitars, two of which are in my little \"man cave\" so that I can just grab and play when I feel like it, and one of which is hanging out of reach of my four-year-old because it has sentimental value that she'll eventually learn to stop trying to touch.\n",
            "850 Made well. I'm pleasantly surprised of how pleasant the bells sound, very smooth. I'm using them on  top of my high hat for a little extra sound. I modified them slightly fir my purposes, but think they would be great as regular ankle bells as well.\n",
            "851 Quality is what I need! I was tempted to go with Behringer, but it originates in China, I have already experienced background noise and some power issues with previous versions do I said no. This has been fantastic on the other hand. Got this about over eight months ago, and so far it's been nothing but reliable and still can be used for quality audio. Also, Yamaha derives from Japan so wow, what a major difference. Thank you!\n",
            "852 I ordered eight of these after reading the reviews.  I have five guitars, including two Les Paul's and they hold them just fine.  I give them four stars.  The are fine for, I believe, all guitars at home, but I wouldn't use them for retail or something like a school.  They are made if ABS plastic and at the point where the arms swivel it's just a rivet the holds them together.  The wall anchors that they send with them are a joke.  like the other reviewer said, you really should find a stud to mount them to, but if you must use wall anchors, use the burly moly ones that bore into the dry wall.  All in all these are sturdy and stable (when anchored to a stud) and I'll use more if I have the need.\n",
            "853 This bridge cover is beautiful. It really adds flare and character to your bass. I personally added it to a Squier Bronco bass that I've modded with Mustang parts.\n",
            "854 seems like a very nice case, but quality control is questionable.  Case was damaged from the factory, no damage to the packaging or plastic bag surrounding the case, indicating the damage occured from the factory.  For the amount that I paid for this case I would expect a product in perfect condition.\n",
            "855 You just can't beat these Hohner blues harmonicas in terms of what you get for the money. Very good sound and playablity, durable, and not too expensive but the price does keep going up. I have 7 of them, some go back years and years (I like Lee Oskar harps too, but I prefer the blues harp as it's \"throatier\"). I see some reviewers have complained that it's hard on the lips or is not very durable; don't know where they're comin' from, no problems for me here (I have a bunch of Hohner Pro harps and they do hurt your lips; as for durabilty: only my oldest blues harp, the A, has a reed out, mainly because I played it for years like a 3 lung madman, the others are in perfect condition). If you want a diatonic harmonica that sounds better than this be prepared to cough up in excess of $100, otherwise get this.\n",
            "856 Great item for studio recording this improve my mix. Fast shipping great products\n",
            "857 I went from fender chrome non-locking to fender gold locking. It made my guitar look beautiful and play beautiful. I think locking tuners are the way to go. If you are new to locking tuners look on YouTube for instructions.\n",

The case that these two came in is very durable. The microphones and clips are securely padded within the case, which makes transporting them a breeze . We tested these out and they worked perfectly fine through the PA. The microphones sounded very clean, but on the bass(ier?) side, which can be adjusted if desired. Overall, this is a great buy! It is really awesome that these come as a set and with a nice hard case! In action, they work really well and 100% could be used in a professional setting. Thanks, Audio 2000s!\n",

            "861 A big improvement over stock pickups on my 1960 Reissue Stratocaster. Lots of high end snap, much less noise, decent balance between pick ups, classic look. Easy to install but does require soldering. The instructions (really just a wiring diagram) could be a bit clearer so be sure and make note of the existing wiring before you des older and remove the old pickups.\n",
            "862 i was expecting extreme brutality but got a pleasant surprise. this pup is super clean no. 1 and distortion is very smooth not at all what expected its warm in tone but has some bite to it. overall i really like this pup. to be honest I was expecting this pickup to be really mid focused but it has a tight punch in the low and the highs are not over bearing either. great pickup would get again!\n",
            "863 I really love the fretwraps, they're really usefull, specially when you need to record something and want a really clean sound, or when you are a bass player that loves the slapping technique.

Ive been setting them up on top of my powered speakers and angle them to hit part of ceilings and tops of walls. They are bright so by mounting them like this prevents squinters on the dance floor and you can see the patterns with out the use of a fog machine. They are housed in plastic and are very light.

So I got it the next day and it arrived with a broken neck it probably was broken by ups, I feel if they would of delivered it that night then they wouldn't have to unload/load it so much,more chance of it breaking. So I got a replacement and this one is almost perfect but for the volume knob on the guitar makes static when you turn it up or down. Now I knowvthat is a common problem generally on older volume pots but this is a brand new guitar. I'm hoping that it will get better with repeated turning.it still is an awesome deal with the amp and other stuff its a pretty sweet sounding guitar especially for what you pay for it.\n",

Its a great Harmonica and it's perfect for a beginner \" so I took their advice and I must say it's Fantastic. Looks and sounds great and I'm s total newbie but I'm having no trouble at all playing single note songs and exercises. I'll most likely purchase one in every key once I'm more confident and skilled with this one\n",

            "876 When I bought my Roland Gaia, I needed another stand, as I already have two keyboards on a double tiered stand, and I think 3 is too much.  The least expensive stand available at \"that other store\" was over $30, so I figured I get something used, or local.  Checking Amazon, I saw this stand, which at the time of my order was $20.00 even.  It seemed like a great value, so I ordered it.  The packaging was a little flimsy, but the stand arrived in one piece and in good condition.  It fit my Gaia perfectly.  The included straps don't work with the Gaia, but the stand holds the keyboard well, and at the right height.  It's a little beefier than stands in that price range, though not as beefy as my 2 tier stand, though that was much more expensive.  This is totally a five star stand at the price I paid, and even at $5.00 more at the time of this review.  For an inexpensive stand, I don't think anyone can do better.  Recommended.\n",

It is heavier duty than my speaker stands and the legs when fully opened will stabilize the biggest  monitor you reasonable would put on a VESA mount that size. The small 17\" one I have on it solid. It is hard to tell in the photo but the mic holders do have a slot on the side so wired as well as wireless mikes can slip in, you'll want to use a round head Shure 58 or equivalent so it doesn't fall through. Like others have said the hardware is top notch, adjustments can be tightened down securely, and the monitor and its adapter can be taken off with just 2 thumb screws for transport. Great deal at the 70 price too!\n",
            "890 The arm is extremely short and should be longer\n",
            "891 This one is much more stable than the brand they have at my music studio.  I like this one way better.  The platform is wider and my foot seems much happier.  Yes, it costs more, but it was worth it for me.  Very happy with the purchase.  And it lays flat for easy storage.\n",
            "892 Small but powerful enough. It is well made, pretty basic for a speaker.  I would probably buy another one.\n",
            "893 I gave a cheaper neck a shot. I am blown away by the look of this neck. The stain used is just enough to highlight the grain nicely and the clear coat is darn near perfect. I figured a lot of time would be during the \"adjustment\" phase of the build. Nothing else had to be done once the neck was set and bolted on. What a pleasant surprise since in past builds I'd spent an hour or more getting them set. I've used Fender and Warmoth before that cost 3 times and more than this one. The proof had been in the pudding though. This neck has been on this guitar for over a year now. No problems. I use this guitar as a back up and play it quite frequently on gigs. I buy more!\n",
            "894 This is a fantastic rack and makes my home studio look really professional.\n",
            "895 Nice tuners.  Installed on a strat neck and they are working great. Nice and smooth and has stayed in tune very well. Nothing wrong with these.\n",
            "896 Awesome stand. Best one I've ever had. It's not that heavy easy to carry in maneuver. The push adjustment for the up-and-down is great quick and easy holds really good. Feels like it's going to last a long time without being overly heavy. I really have no complaints thing works great. I did put a counterweight cuz my tube recording mic is kind of heavy.. wish I could buy 20 for 50 bucks. Wish they had a deal for multiple...\n",
            "897 I was surprised of the quality of this mic. I used it for recording sessions and sounded clean. I would definitely recommend to anyone to purchase this product. I did not use the unbalanced cable it came with because I had balanced cables that were better to use.\n",
            "898 Nice guitar.\n",
            "899 I just tested this fog fluid with a 1byone 400W fogger. Two 30 second bursts were sufficient to create enough fog layers for a moody atmosphere in a 2 car garage. This being a hot space I was pleasantly surprised by how long the fog would linger. It would quickly rise to eye level and then just hang there. Another nice surprise was the odor- there is not much of it, but if you step in the middle of a thick pocket it smells like lavender (?) soap.\n",
            "900 Unfortunately I received plastic pins with black dots. Not happy and have to return them.\n",
            "901 Cable quality is great, as usual from monoprice. However, Monoprice used a very sticky tape that left a huge amount of tape-glue on the cable rather than two twist ties or similar..Went through 10 minutes and 3 clorox wipes getting it all (mostly) off. Unusual for them.\n",
            "902 Just got my pedal board yesterday!  I love it.  Before I had my pedals strewn all over the floor.  Now they're organized and easier to use.  The board is larger than I expected b/c I didn't pay attention to the measurements in the description.  But I'm glad I chose this one.  It gives me an excuse to purchase more pedals.  Obviously the stock photo shows many pedals placed really close together which is not realistic considering the cables that are involved.  I'm attaching photos of my board for better reference.  Eventually, as I add more pedals I will place the power supply under the board, but for now I like the blue illumination of the AGP power supply.\n",
            "903 This was supposed to be red tortoise.  It's actually closer to brown tortoise.  Maybe in between red and brown but certainly not what I consider red tortoise. I actually have another guitar in need of a brown tortoise cover so I'm using it on that one so not that big a deal, however will not work on my intended red tortoise guitar.  I've attached pic of the this cover which is on the guitar on the left.  The one on the right is what I consider a proper red tortoise.\n",
            "904 Overall I'm happy with the stand.  I admit I was scratching my head a bit when I was putting it together.  There's more pieces to this stand than others I've had.  Adjusting it is a little bit of a pain because there are 4 different areas that you can loosen and change around.  If you travel and gig a lot, you may want to go with the higher model, the adjustments look a bit easier.  However once all setup, it's sturdy and well built.\n",
            "905 Great price and good quality.  It didn't quite match the radius of my sound hole but it was close enough.\n",
            "906 I have a garage sale piece of junk MIJ hollowbody that I've used Amazon to build for cheap.  It's been a blast and this fit the bill perfectly.\n",
            "907 A great product if you need to connect a guitar to a computer or other USB compatible recording device. The cord is incredibly well made. I would say this is for home-use or hobby recording. It would be wonderful to be used to save song ideas or songs in the making. The connections work just fine and are well made. The cord is nice and long so it's comfortable to sit or stand and play and not feel too attached to a computer. The connection points are nice and sturdy so they won't break. If you are in the market for one of these types of guitar cables, I do recommend this one.\n",
            "908 So i needed a cheap guiar that i could bang into walls and not care, so i got this thinking it would be perfect for the job. Sadly, i fell in love with it even though they sent me the wrong guitar. (Amazon falsely advertised it). I got the brown sunburst (absolutely beautiful) but instead of a white puckguard, i got brown sparkly one. Oh well $10 and 30 minutes later and i can fix that. Anyway. It sounds great for a $125 and plays amazingly.\n",
            "909 I put these in a new bass I built last week.\n",
            "910 Outstanding case!  My H6 fits into this case perfectly.  It is made of heavy duty plastic, which is at least twice as thick at the case that comes with the H6.  Each cut-out within the foam interior is custom sized to fit your H6 and all of the accessories.  The latches are very sturdy.  See picture to get a sense of the size in relation to the standard H6 case.  BUY IT...\n",
            "911 These really tidy up my practice board. I like the little donner pedals and these chain them nicely. I do Velcro them down so at some point Ill have to deal with taking stuff apart but.... oh well.\n",
            "912 Absolutely awesome cables for the money. I've bought a number of these in different colors. The connectors are really decent and the cables are very well made- nice silicone jacket.  I've shortened a number of these LyxPro cables using the original ends for balanced line use in a patch bay.and also using, Neutrix TRS connectors, Neutric XLR's, Switchcraft right angle TRS ends, and even some ends of off some Seismic Audio cables.\n",
            "913 I have worked in radio for over 12 years as well as voiceover.  My main microphone has been the big brother to this one.  Most radio studios you enter use the RE20.  That being said when I recieved this RE 320 I was blown away.  I have done my radio show with it exclusively for the past 8 months and love it!  This mic ROCKS!  This microphone has XLR connections so be sure to use good mixer with those standard connections for a top quality mic like this.  When you first get this microphone you immediately notice the professional look and feel to it.  It is all that you would imagine it to be. Simply put this mic is top quality and produces great sound even without processing.  5 STARS!\n",
            "914 Light is bright, light weight, and small in size. Works great in auto mode and sound activated mode. This light almost goes 360 degrees, and will easily fill a backyard or small hall.\n",
            "915 The Ditto is the best looper I've owned (I've tried a few). It's very easy to use.\n",
            "916 Cool little box, I'm using it with my Arturia Microbrute analog synth, looks cool, sound good, easy to use, fits well in gig bag.\n",
            "917 Installed these humbuckers on my Epiphone Les Paul Standard. The sound of the neck and bridge humbuckers are very similar. The bridge just has a tad bit more treble. However, both of these HBs produce a very, very warm sound. When playing with an MXR Distortion + it produces a grunge/fuzz sound but keeps clarity of each note. The clarity is outstanding on the HBs-each note can be heard. The HBs are not very versatile, only producing a grunge/fuzz sound, regardless of what distortion pedal I use but it fits my playing style at the moment so I am very happy with them.\n",
            "918 If you're looking for a gig bag for a semi-hollow guitar or bass, this will do the job. Make sure you are looking for part number 0991622206 - that's the Metro Gig Bag for Semi Hollow basses.\n",
            "919 This case is awesome!  The molded interior fits my Fender Jazz Bass like a glove and I feel it's secured at all times.  This is the second case I've owned and the quality is superb!  It balances much better in my hand while carrying it than my last case which was a bit front heavy.  It's also lighter in weight than my previous case too.  The open compartment is deep enough to fit my cable, strap, tuner, accessories and I usually throw my amp power cable in there too.  I also like that the open compartment does not have a door that you always have to open or close.  Just open the case and everything is there for easy access.  Lastly, cosmetically this case is very sweet looking.  The black, white and chrome details are perfect and of course the chrome Fender logo on the top of the case really sets it off.\n",
            "920 These sticker pentagrams are real nice. Have some left over and put them on my violin. Badass.\n",
            "921 I installed this kit in my Squier by Fender Vintage Modified Stratocaster. What a great upgrade. The guitar comes with all those tiny pots and cheap electronics. Get yourself one of these kits if your guitar came with cheap electronics. It is a Tone Buster... :) PS I added a few other mods myself.\n",
            "922 I wanted gold jacks, not silver. I've built a Steeler-themed guitar (see photo) and these silver jacks are wrong. Will you exchange it for the gold jacks?\n",
            "923 Works as advertised (I'm sure along with the other 5 or 6 brands out there that are the exact same one- see pic it's the one they shipped). Only thing I'd say is pay attention to your current- everything worked fine except my wireless (line 6). It'd power up but then go dark. Turns out it was plugged into a 100ma port. It needs upwards of 300+ma. Plugged into the correct port and it was fine. So far no issues after about 6 or 7 gigs. I'm surprised because it's priced so cheap. Comes with all the barrel (power) cords (Not the 1/4\" cords). Can't go wrong for under $40.\n",
            "924 I have a 1986 Peavey Patriot made in the usa guitar. It had one cheap string tree that wasn't a roller. These work great! Make sure to drill the holes for any of these trees you are going to install. The included screw cannot handle the pressure of screwing it in. I will add pictures soon. You won't be disappointed. They add incredible sustain to my guitar!\n",
            "925 First of all, I am a HUGE Fender fan. Guitars, amps and especially their pickups.  Second, when it comes to tone, I am very picky. I love the Fender Custom Shop 69s, 54s, 57/62s and Fat 50s. I wanted to try something other than Fender this time, so I chose these SSL-1s. So far I think they are absolutely the best single coil pickup I have ever had. Big, full tone with bell-like highs and a clear bottom end.  On a lot of pickups in Strats the neck pickup can sound too quacky, too much twang and it over powers everything else.  These strike a very nice balance with quack and all the other harmonics that are present.  Some other vintage single coils Ive tried have too much chimey-ness in the tone, too much high, drowns out the mids, again these SSL-1s don't do that, even though there is still tons of chimey, bell-like tones, like glass breaking, very brilliant, but its balanced out with the mid and low tones as well.  Very nice and yes I would buy them again.\n",
            "926 At the Price point and what it deliveres it's a must buy. I play Bass. Only a few things I can gripe about and it's the clarity of the notes not being as clear and the split with the music (aux) and headphones..gotta find the right spot. That said it's built great for plastc...very sturdy..and the fact I can USE AAA batteries and not LITHIUM BUILT IN is what sold me over others too! (Buy your own batteries)  Comes with cheap batteries. The device works so well I can change two batteries but if the built in stop working and it fades away.. device is no good. Nobody knows I'm evening practicing or jamming. Very nice should have baught along time ago. I use Beats headphones and Uiisii Us90 ear buds sold on Amazon..the best earbuds you will find!($10!) Find them!  Why the Beats? I use the cord for aux to phone. But u can get an aux cord ..(preference)\n",
            "927 Fits my Squier Stratocaster (Bullet) great, with a few inches to spare lengthwise.  Theres a ton of great zipper pockets, the handles are great and the padding is pretty decent. I use this for light traveling for my cheaper guitars. In my opinion I would not put an expensive guitar in here as the padding isn't the best, but it will still resist scratches and small bangs but more than likely not drops.\n",
            "928 5 stars. For its price and size, couldn't have asked for more.\n",
            "929 Love it! I have had other tuners & recently bought a pedal tuner. I like this because it's much more convenient. The pedal wears through 9 volt batteries pretty quick, so I'm constantly plugging & unplugging. W/ this one, I just move it from one headstock to another & turn it on/off as desired...\n",
            "930 I have a Martin guitar and Martin strings are the only ones I use.\n",
            "931 This stand is perfect.  For the price, it's hard to see why anyone would settle for cheaper.  The stand is stable and locks the guitar to the stand at the head stock. The locking mechanism senses weight and locks the guitar in place without extraneous adjustments.\n",
            "932 Ordered a \"MUGIG\" tuner, but received one with a \"Musedo\" brand mark. (See photo) Who is \"Musedo\", anyway?! I'm sure I'm correct in my assumption that these inexpensive tuners are mass-produced in China and receive all manner of brand name logos on them.\n",
            "933 This is now the second pop filter I have purchased of this brand, and there has been one significant upgrade that I am jealous that my previous purchase of item didn't have. I have been setting up two separate recording PC's at home, and my son wanted a similar setup as I had. The first filter I had purchased still works and I liked its ease of use. I was pleasantly surprised to see the one thing I disliked about mine had been changed.\n",
            "934 I like these things. Bought 12 of them and Never had a problem. They come with drywall mounts as well as stud screws.  I always put into studs. Mutch safer than lots of stands that can fall over. Great price and solid.\n",
            "935 These were perfect in every way for my application.  I installed these on a MIM stratocaster (I had to drill three holes in the tremolo plate to do so) and they were the correct NARROW string width ( 2 - 1/16\" ) for my application.  I was even able to top-load the strings through the holes where the intonation screws originally fed through, just to piss off the purists.  It worked so well that I am doing the same modification to another of my import strats, but this time with graph tech saddles.  Those ones will work as well, but I have to sand off some injection mold flaws first (although that will be easy as well).  I'm a believer in either brass or graphite when it comes to the break-angles of strings and these were literally perfect.\n",
            "936 First of all these lights look great! The flashing patterns and bright lights really add pazaz to a party or get together as long as the lights are dimmed of course. The LX-5 has a built-in microphone which is used to match up the light flashes to the beat of a song playing, and this works very well as long as your speakers have a subwoofer (built in or external). I listened to some dubstep tracks while using this and I couldn't believe how accurate it was! The lights alternated between each color during the climb, and flashed in a unison strobe at the drop!\n",
            "937 I'm writing several different reviews here on Amazon to inform all of the shoppers that ALL of the low priced scissor arm mic stands on Amazon right now are the exact same model, just branded with the different logo. I actually picked up the \"neewer\" brand one because it said it came with an integrated XLR cable and a shock mount, but it did NOT, even when I exchanged it for another. Even the box said it has those accessories, but none were included.\n",
            "938 The fender modern player stratocaster is a great guitar, I bought this guitar and modified it with chrome pickup covers and chrome knobs, it is a great looking and great sounding, I strongly recommend this guitar.\n",
            "939 Absolutely amazing! I think they are direct knock-off of Seymour Duncan SH-2 Jazz Model Humbucker Pickups. (you can see the same little holes on each of pups) Powerful, bright sound, no noise. My old Johnson LP with ex \"EMG-ish\"  pickups are now fully awake and angry in a good way. Great quality! Thanks everyone for good review.\n",
            "940 Thickest and most durable beater patch on the market. Buy this even if you don't use Aquarian heads. It'll prolong the life of any head!\n",
            "941 I recently got a used, but excellent, Epiphone Junior.  I've been playing for over fifty years and owned many -- many quite fine, costly, guitars. But as others have discovered, these older, P90-equipped Epis belie their cost. They play and sound GREAT.  With one exception: They come with pretty poor tuners.\n",
            "942 I have both Teles and Strats, and they both rite in this case perfectly. The extra storage areas are great, and you don't get outside storage pockets on a hard case.  The case is very well made, durable, and light.  I think the price for this product is a very good value. I know this will suit my needs perfectly!\n",
            "943 These are not bad for the price and have a good feel to them weight wise. I would say beginner sticks for sure but once you get to be a better drummer and you are learning how to make different sounds with your kit like a rim shot. These will snap off fast. It didn't take too long for my son to snap the tip off doing a rim/head hit. if these are for a electric kit, I would give these a 5 star for that perpose\n",
            "944 These are too thin to be effective on their own.  I love these for their color and overall aesthetics.\n",
            "945 This is great. I bought for another reason but used it instead on my hihat and removed the legs which it is meant to do. Its more solid than with legs and less clutter. Now I have to buy another for the original purpose. I love it.\n",
            "946 I've been using this little amp for over a month now and totally love it.  I run it into a small cabinet with a Jensen Vintage C8R4 8-inch ceramic speaker housed in a maple 12\" x 12\" cabinet and it sounds amazing.  If you closed your eyes you would think you were hearing a Fender Tweed combo from the 50's.  I use a delay/reverb combo pedal in the effects loop insert and it's as sweet as the larger setups I have in my main music room.  I use this in my office and it's perfect for the space.  I can't believe such vintage tones can come out of a chip-amp that is as small as a stomp pedal.  If you're looking for extremely high gain, try one of the other Hotone amps like the Legacy British Invasion or Purple Wind.\n",
            "947 Monster grips are a necessity for guitarists and bassists who demand that their pick has a grippy surface! They adhesive on them is very strong and will stick to picksp made of any material. I use them on carbon fiber picks, bone picks, brass pics & horn picks.  I've discovered that they are also handy for other things as well such as pictures and frames on my wall. One monster grip on the back corners of the picture frame will keep them from sliding crooked on the wall!\n",
            "948 It works! This is a nice product I'm happy, however there are some things I noticed but nothing to take much away from the pedal, especially considering the low price.\n",
            "949 Great little set. Practice pads with options!\n",

The mic isn't the best I have ever seen but for the price range it sure is good. I was skeptical but the XLR did come in handy. And it is heaps better than any built in microphone for any other webcam, laptop etc. The headphones are excellent, far better than any other headphones you'll get for fifty bucks.\n",
            "951 Judging from the reviews, the quality must be variable, but this one was a quick bolt-on. The neck was straight and even had the correct relief; frets were smooth and will require only minimum hand rolling of the ends. This one had the correct strat heel shape.  It is a beautiful fretboard with lots of character; the inexpensive nut was the right height and easy enough to replace.  I was able to brand it with my logo, give it a few coats of tung oil and put it on a handmade custom ordered offset guitar that I just finished in my workshop. I've ordered another.\n",
            "952 Nice heavy duty drawer.\n",
            "953 Love it. Thick plastic. Good quality ez install.\n",
            "954 Better than or equal to the higher priced competition. I've used the competition product and prefer this one. Plus the remote comes free, can't beat that.\n",
            "955 I was invited to play quasi-Dixieland banjo for a quasi-Dixieland musical (\"The Boy Friend\").  They told me my banjo wasn't loud enough though I thought it was plenty loud. I didn't want to mess with a mike since the sound guys never get that right.  Or with running a DI into the sound board for the same reason.  So I ordered this pickup from Amazon and installed it.  I ran it through a small Crate combo amp (XT65R); it was plenty loud - in fact I'll be cutting it back tonight.  Sound was OK, would probably be better through an \"acoustic amp,\" but it's good enough for the musical.\n",
            "956 Looking at these on a guitar when they don't have a single wrap on the post, I found it hard to believe the strings would even stay on but I have now installed two sets of these on two different guitars. One black set and the other is gold. The first guitar would not stay in tune so I tried these. They have been on for nearly a year now and they totally fixed my tuning problem. The second set I put on my brand new Gibson Les Paul only because the first ones worked so well. Super easy fast string changes with the auto trim feature, and no tuning issues at all. At 18:1 gear ratio they dial in a perfect tune and hold it. I prefer these over Grover or any other higher priced tuners available.\n",
            "957 Superb built quality and sound. Seriously you pay for the Moog name but damn is it built solid.\n",
            "958 I was hoping that these weren't cheap quality-wise, and they're not. They are perfect. Fits awesomely on my Shure SM58 and Peavey PV mics.\n",
            "959 Upgrading from a Numark Mixtrack Pro to this is night and day.  While I didn't buy it off amazon, I've attached my picture of the set up.  Definitely... buy a high quality flight case.  You don't want to haul a $1000 masterpiece and haul this in something that doesn't protect your investment.\n",
            "960 My oldest son and husband are avid guitar players. We have close to 20 guitars in our home both acoustic and electric. Since my son began playing guitar he has gone through at least 6 Capo's. It had become a joke in our family whenever we drove past Guitar Center we would ask our son if he needed a new Capo.\n",
            "961 Really nice product if you don't have a whole lot of money. It sounds a little mid-range e . Other than that it's a nice product.\n",
            "962 These went on my new Strat a day after my white Strat came home. The only reason is for you! Changing strings in no time. Do they do anything else, nope.\n",
            "963 I put this on a Yamaha drum rack. The tubes are rather large and this thing opened just wide enough to clamp on. I was really surprised. When I first opened the packed I was thinking I'd have to send it back, but it works perfectly and the clamp is very secure. I submitted a picture of it installed. It doesn't look like it's on all the way, but this thing hasn't moved in almost a year!! I would highly recommend this product!!\n",
            "964 Truthfully, I had no idea that the even were ukulele capos. But why not? I use them on guitars and banjo, and there are certainly times when you might want to shift key without transposing so you can take advantage of open strings.\n",
            "965 Cheap and effective. You'll need to print your own decals, but it's MUCH less expensive than the 70 bucks some other fool was trying to get out of us. They look great! Fits my Shure mics nice and snug. Will need to play with the SM57 a bit - not much room left to grab the mic with a foam screen. But we'll work through that.\n",
            "966 This happened (check out my picture) in about 3 to 6 months of use. I guess you by cheap, you get cheap results.\n",
            "967 This pop filter works perfect and I like that it's easily adjustable. The images show a all black pop filter but I received a white and pink/purple filter. That's the only reason I'm going to give it 3 starts. Isn't a little strange and everyone always comments on that fact. It kind of throws off the vibe of my booth. I'll be purchasing anyone some time in the future from a different company most likely because I want a black one. Image attached.\n",
            "968 Odyssey 8-Space Rack is great. I put casters on mine to move it around when I need to.\n",

            "974 I though this was gonna be three green packs separate, but came in one green pack. It has all 3 sets but the sets inside are separate in clear plastic for each. The strings themselves are very good. I love these for electric guitar.\n",
            "975 Works with a Heil PR 40 after taking off the bottom cap. In doing this you need to utilize the piece that comes with your PR40 and secure your mic by screwing it to the bottom of your mic after putting it into the shock mount. Would of liked a natural fit without doing this but for the price it can't be beat and works very well.\n",
            "976 I diid an \"All Fender, All Over\" (as much as practical) upgrade to a $190 GFS Xaviere \"Tele\".  It came exceptionally well packaged an absolutely no flaws. Unlike the cover that came with the guitar, this one is non magnetic, which is a good thing. The GFS guitar is mostly vintage specs and this cover fit perfectly. Makes me wonder if some of the other reviewers got knock offs. I always buy original manufacturer stuff when doing a hardware upgrade, especially if it's only a few bucks more. I've had my fill of trying to fit crappy, cheap, import stuff. Don't get me wrong, there is some really good import stuff out there, but you really have to know what to look for and do your homework.\n",

            "979 For the price, it can't be beat. I hadn't picked up a fiddle in 50 years, so I didn't want to invest a lot of money in something I wouldn't use, but I was pleasantly surprised by this instrument. Of course it's not a high dollar violin, but there is nothing wrong with it.\n",
            "980 I own 3 of these Minis.  Quality on this one is the worst. Glue joints at the neck/body were messy. Had a couple of small dings (see photo of one under strings near bridge) but the important stuff is OK ( neck is straight and the bridge is sound). Fret edges are very smooth. Sounds great but not as good as the Ovangkol.\n",
            "981 Okay, the idea is good, but the materials used are inferior. What good is a locking mechanism if the cheap plastic breaks off? The plastic part that the nylon strap is looped through broke clean off, right on stage. Luckily it was right at the end of a song as I played the last chord, and I held onto the guitar so it didn't go crashing down on the stage. But it could have, I was just lucky. Where the strap loops onto the plastic mechanism is the weak link. The locking part is a good idea. Not going to trust this thing with my instruments though. I had an old Ernie Ball spare strap in my case with simple leather ends. I will use it from now on.\n",
            "982 This guitar is far more beautiful in person. The red to gold tones blend so wonderfully and it has a barely visible tiger-stripe/wood pattern effect that I hadn't noticed prior to purchasing it. I got it here for a fraction of the price I was finding it other places. I have had no problems with it whatsoever yet, it plays easily and sounds like I spent a lot more on it than I did. It even arrived sooner than was expected.\n",

This bag is made very well and has heavy duty zippers. It has 10 dividers that Velcro in and can be moved. The bottom velcros in too for nice padding. At first the bag seemed short inside so I removed the bottom and placed it in properly to get the right height. It also has a nice shoulder strap. Finally a great product. I am now a Phitz fan!\n",
            "985 I purchased this kit to have an organized and efficient way of changing my guitar strings (electric and acoustic). I like that the tools are all organized in one pouch, there are slots for string set(s), so that you never have to worry about being unprepared for a guitar emergency (hence the name \"gig\" mate).\n",

I was a complete newb when I bought this model 5 months ago - took it to a friend who's been playing for 30 years and he was really impressed with everything about it.  As a result of having such a good time learning on this one I upgraded 3 weeks ago to an Epiphone Les Paul Standard Red Royale Model.  I got the LP-100 back out last night for the heck of it and am Still impressed with it. Had thought about selling it when I got the new Epi LP but I think now I will hold on to it awhile!!

            "989 When I first pulled this out of the box I was pleasantly surprised. There were quite a few negative reviews, so I was half expecting  it to arrive in pieces. But it was packaged well and already assembled, so I was pretty happy. Once I had it installed on my rack, I noticed the cable holes in the back aren't even punched out! The main reason I bought this was to store my noisy external hard drive.  I can't do that now, so I guess this drawer is just going to hold random crap that I have on my desk.  I'm honestly pretty bummed. I was tempted to give this two stars, but the drawer itself is pretty acceptable for the price. If you don't need to run cables through the back of it,  then I don't see any reason this wouldn't work for you.\n",

I also own a Scarlet 2i2 (Gen 1)  which I use in my primary studio  I find the 2i2 has superior sound quality  less audible distortion / lower noise  and I prefer the 2i2's Neutrik style XLR/TRS output connector. The Behringer is a good value  it works fine and has good features / performance for the price  but like other Behringer products I've used, the sound quality / noise / distortion, leave me wanting a better product. If features or budget are at the top of your list, this product should do the job; if however sound quality is of primary importance then I'd recommend the Scarlet 2i2 (look for sales or a used Gen 1).\n",

I have installed these strings on two of my basses and I find them to be most excellent for my needs.  For one thing, these kind of strings are not \"fret eaters\" due to their flatwound smooth surface.  Also, they are lots easier on your fingers if you should play that way.  The various tones and behaviors that these strings produce is hard to describe, but it is a situation that very much agrees with me.  You almost have to hear them to really know.  I just got done installing a set of these DR\\'s on a Reverend Thundergun 4 string bass and they sound awesome.  It might be noted that this bass has a 34\" scale neck and string through bridge.  I had no problems with installation or in tuning.  I am pretty much committed to these style of bass strings.  However a word of caution here.  These strings are not supposed to fit long scaled necks.  I shall conclude this review with 6 pictures.  5 stars on these strings for dang sure :)', \"This strap is well made and is very comfortable. I installed Dunlop Straploks, which was a chore because the leather is so thick, but I got them on without cutting or modifying the strap. The leather is soft and the padding is nice.

After troubleshooting, I solder out the tone control and switched it for the volume pot that seemed to be shorted out perhaps from too much heat from the ground soldering on the back from the factory. Everything worked but there was still hum that I eliminated by running it through an effects pedal. The second one worked but had overwhelming static and hum, but it was cheap. I wired bypassing the controls, plugged it into a separate volume pedal and into an amp. It works fine now but with a little hum. I may still use these in the future because they are very inexpensive. I would use a better and more expensive pickups on better quality guitars. In the future, for one of my inexpensive projects, I would probably just order the pickup without the wiring harness and controls. But, rethinking, even buying an output jack and a bit of shielded cable at Radio Shack would have been more expensive in the end.

You can only adjust it with the tab in the closed position, as opposed to the position shown in the instructions, defeating the easy on/off feature. Also the bracket that attaches the clamp to the cup holder uses a single screw, which loosened up while I was trying to attach the clamp to a mic stand.

I adjusted them a couple of times (not too high) and may have found the sweet spot. I don't change pickups too often but the fat 50's sounded too farty and muffled to my ears. I also like to play a wide range of styles ranging from Jeff Beck jazz to Yngwie Neoclassical to John Mayer blues. These pickups are able to handle those styles easily. Most importantly they are dead silent and that's important when you're doing a lot of recording.\", 'With a much needed modification, this became a far more durable board.', \"Guys, this is a really good sounding pedal.  It has enough highs-lows-mids to make you smile.  The sound is similar to pedals costing much more.  Of course, everything is based on taste and the kind of music you play.  This is not a super scooped metal pedal.  It's best for strong overdrives and smooth grudge sounds.  The big factor about this pedal compared to more expensive pedals is that it doesn't like HEAT.  I had a gig in Detroit on a metal stage with a 100 degree PLUS day.  The pedal didn't like it at all.  My BOSS Blues driver was just fine.  Of course the Blues Driver is a $100 pedal. It took the temps just fine. So, that is, in my opinion, the big difference between what you get with JOYO vs other, more expensive, pedals.  Keep in mind, if you are not playing in 100 degree temperatures you have nothing to fear. So, rock on and enjoy your music!!\", 'Just upgraded to this board and I am very happy I did. I needed more stereo inputs and this one had 4 of them. When it comes to an internet radio station you need a clean quiet board. I have no noise coming out of this board so I am very pleased.

I did not bust out the calipers but it is at least as thick as the older version. It is not plastic, nor pot metal. It comes with screws. For giggles, I stopped by Guitar Center after installing it and yep...all American Standard Strats have this exact same neck plate.', 'This strap is advertised for a mandolin, but I put it on my ukulele. I found guitar straps (usually 2 inches wide) and even dedicated ukulele straps (usually 1.5 inches wide) to be too bulky and uncomfortable. This strap is only 3/8\" inch wide, but my ukulele is so lightweight that I really don\\'t need anything wider and a narrower strap doesn\\'t get in the way of my arms and hands. Installing this strap without removing my ukulele strings took some effort. I had to unthread the strap loop (which is really much tighter than it needs to be), then thread the strap end under my ukulele strings, then thread it back through the strap loop (which is still much tighter than it needs to be). The plastic buckle in the middle of the strap is not removable, so you need to thread that through strap loop and it is a real tight fit. Once installed, the strap works great. The thin soft-ish cotton is more comfortable on my shoulder than thick leather or stiff nylon strap and it doesn\\'t seem to scratch my ukulele wood at all.', \"If you're looking for an inexpensive party light, this is a great option.  The beams are pretty tight and is really set off with a fog machine.  The speaker inside was shocking at first (when you plug it in there is a commanding voice talking about bluetooth connectivity.)  There is a little wireless remote that is useful within 10 feet or so.  The motor is a bit loud but with music playing you won't notice.\", \"I Purchased this unit primarily for sweetening up a violin pickup and an acoustic guitar with an LR Baggs pickup. I'm highly impressed with the improvement in the acoustic guitars tone and character. The parametric equalizer is fantastic for dialing in perfect tone. The unit is dead quiet, the only noise noted was when I tightened up the bandwidth and boosted level into the upper 3rd of its range on the parametric eq. In microphone applications the unit performs equally well and the low cut worked great for reduction of handling noise. This is a fantastic tool at a bargain price. I own an ART tube MP preamp also and this unit is definitely a solid step up from the MP. Thanks to Behringer for making great quality affordable products for musicians on a budget. The only knock I can come up with at this point is that the manual is extremely basic and if you're a new user of mic pre's you're kind of on your own. It would be nice if they had included some application recommendations for basic settings,\", 'I previously purchased the 20\\' cable for my SG and Marshall amp, and I was very satisfied. I have a couple of pedals with different variations that I wanted to incorporate, and the old saying \"If it ain\\'t broke, don\\'t fix it\" came to mind. So I ordered 2 of the 6\\' cables to complete my personal set up. You can\\'t go wrong with these. Great Cords!', \"Love this stuff so far. Looks awesome and I can definitely hear the difference acoustically. Hoping I don't run into the blue / green issue that other reviewers have seen.\", \"Love the beefy strings.  Depending on the style of music you play, you might want to give the heavier strings a spin around the block.  If you're on full-tilt distortion all the time, you probably won't see a difference, but if you play without a lot of pedals and like that slightly crunchy breakup to come from your amp, the Beefy strings can make a big difference.\", \"Another update. How can you sell these to people! I have a craft show this weekend and i went to put these tumers on and none id the screws fit! First one i didn't realize and it got stuck. I had to use two pliers to pull it off and scratched mlthe new neck i just finished making. Your company shpuld not be selling these! I now hqve to run out and find somewhere to but 6 sets ....Update....i ordered more, they came in odd. The top is too wide that the nuts don't fit!\", 'As I said elsewhere, the pick wears on the edges, and breaks very quickly, within hours if you play hard. I use it on an acoustic guitar with Medium to Light strings, so really! After at least 3 years, I am still using my Dunlop medium guitar pick. The rubber part also \"hangs\" on the low E string, especially if you are trying to hit it for the first beat of the measure or simply for emphasis. This is probably a bad habit, which I could unlearn, but only if the pick would last longer!', \"Works great as a guitar bench mat. Not rugged enough for abuse but if you take care of it, it will take care of you. Makes organization of workspace much easier because screws won't roll around. Color is good too.\", 'I ordered these for my Road Worn Player Tele,  They fit perfectly. no more winding strings and my tuning problems have been resolved!!!!!!!!!!', 'Everything met my expectations the product was good quality, easy to install even without directions included and my guitars look great hanging on the wall. I read negative reviews saying that the quality was crap and it took them an hr to get it threaded onto the base. Unless you have no basic knowledge of being handy this will not be a problem just make sure you find a stud on the wall and screw the included screws through the drywall and securely into the stud. Before you do this  run the  screw that attaches to the base through the threads to avoid any issues like the negative reviewer had. After you attach the base to the wall thread in the guitar hanger screw firmly and you are good to go. I personally would easily buy one of these for the price of 2 they are great quality for the price and if you have more than one guitar to hang then this product is a must buy!!!!', 'I purchased two of these to hang guitars in my music room. These are well made and certainly do the job okay. However, I completely did NOT trust the two skimpy screws they provided to hang this unit. They are basically drywall screws, but these have a rather skinny diameter. I was not about to trust my vintage P-Bass to a skinny screw inside a hollow-wall fastener. No, I used a heavier \"construction screw\" directly into a wall stud. See photo. I was seriously concerned that the supplied skinny screw would actually break off in the stud. If you are hanging a lightweight acoustic, then the supplied hardware should be fine. I\\'m probably just being paranoid and overly cautious.  Other than that, I like it (tho walnut piece could be a little bigger in my opinion).', \"Great, lightweight product that easily replaces some of my older lighting that's nearly eight times the size and weight.  Having two synced with a DMX cable easily fills the room.  The extra colors not available in many of the big name lights is great addition (orange, purple and white).  Only time will tell how reliable they are.  I'm not a big fan of the white house (which glows), but aside from that, they're perfect.\", \"Bag itself seems to be nice enough, certainly the stand fits. The strap failed me and broke upon first use, not even with heavy weight in it. The carabiner slipped out of the socket thing. I don't know how to explain it, all I know is I had to replace the strap altogether.\", \"I bought this bcos it was cheap. The fastener is difficult to unclip due to its tiny size. I have small hands. I like it better if the strings are shorter, so it won't dangle. So far it serves me well\", 'This is nominally a violin/viola stand, but due to the length and neck diameter, also works well as a mandolin stand. My Paris Swing mandolin fits nicely into the Auto Grip holder. An added bonus is that my Irish bodhran (18\" frame drum) rests comfortably on top of the Auto Grip assembly, with the bottom of the rim resting against the padded legs as does the body of a stringed instrument.', 'This thing kicks some serious butt. An excellent, deep, thumping subwoofer. It really rounds out our sound. The first day I got it I ended up with a sheriff in my front yard asking me to turn it down. :)', 'Perfect fit on my Epiphone LP 100.... My beginner guitar.  Had to decide if I wanted to sell my LP-100 after upgrading to an LP Standard.  Decided to keep LP 100 for sentimental reasons but wanted to get rid of Cream colored trim.  Swapped out cream colored pick-up trim and the poker chip for Black ....love it', 'I manage a classic rock band. I recently ordered a bunch of stuff to replace aging gear. Cables, mics, stands, snakes, etc. We have now been out on a couple of gigs with the stuff. It is all good quality and working fine. Does exactly what I expected it to do. No surprises. In the interest of time I am applying this exact same review to all of the items I bought for this purpose and am happy with. FWIW, I am also taking the time to be critical of the items I am not completely happy with.', 'this pedal is for marshall amps it with a e.q. and compressor made a awsome metal skull ripping tone I was thinking of a voodo mod but a friend told me about the pedal and man its got more than enough gain  i mean lots of distortion it and eq compressor makes for a great combo  so get rid of all the tube screamers and go to the turbo rat if you got a marshall', \"Competitors had detailed drawings and better pictures causing me to worry I'd made a mistake with these.

Sounds great, doesn't go out of tune too much, but I read that is normal in new instruments so no worries there.\", \"Tiny little amp. I have never seen these in my retail shops. I just ordered from here. After putting in a 9V battery and plugged in my Gretsch guitar, instantly I heard the punching sound of rockabilly. Never did I ever heard any strange sounds of feedback or popping or screeching. It was quiet and perfect for me even when I played it real close to the amp. I did not purchase the DC adaptor, just relying on batteries. Imagine I could play electric guitar in my car, how portable is this thing! The bad thing about this is that the box packaging looks cheap and printing was bad. The brand name of the amp is located at its back, kind of shy of telling others it's Fender. At first I suspected it was fake. However the sound doesn't lie. I realized this amp cost more than the others, not sure if other brands are equally good as well.\", 'This happened (check out my picture) in about 3 to 6 months of use. I guess you by cheap, you get cheap results.', 'No the best sound but for practice along without disturbing the neiborhoods is the cheap and best option...', \"I LOVE this thing. It works as a VOLUME pedal, WAH pedal and EXPRESSION pedal, all in one. Also, the WAH sounds amazing. The small size of the top plate makes it a breeze to use and pull off all kinds of things that are much more difficult with a full size wah.  In short, it's built like a tank, sounds amazing and looks great :)\", \"Don't care what anyone says, these things are great. I've completely upgraded my lighting with just two of these. Nice and bright, easy to setup master and slave and very durable if treated with care and properly stored/transported.\", 'This would be my fourth Ocarina Wind ocarina. It is by far my FAVORITE. I love the \"Sound of Earth\" design. The mouthpiece is perfectly sized. The body design is very comfortable and feels natural to hold. The rough finish makes it feel sturdy and adds some nice grip! The slight indent at the subholes makes it very easy and comfortable to use them. (My trumpet creeper ocarina\\'s subholes are a pain, and the \"rythym of the earth\" are a little close, I am always hitting them on accident!) It is also the most in tune, all notes! It has a great, mellow but resonating sound. I would love to see more aesthetics with this body design! I truly was surprised. I have 3 other ocarinas from them that are more than reasonably priced for decent product, but this one in particular blew my expectations out of the water! I definitely recommend this for any level, especially beginner at this price. It is worth much more than what it is being sold for! I actually bought another!', 'All I have to do is install this on my Strat. Instructions gave me a good idea of what needs to be done, and I have experience with all kinds of stuff since I was involved with all types of Proto-Typing in many different machine shops so it should be a fun project.', \"I play guitar with a flat pick. But I also play ukulele, and hard picks can make the uke sound a little harsh. I've tried felt uke picks, but they never felt comfortable. So I use one of these Alaska Pik Fingerpicks over my index finger for strumming. Size is important. I have medium sized hands, and these picks can slip off my fingertip when it's hot and muggy, like when I'm playing at an outdoor market. That can cause some awkwardness when trying to strum, sing and keep the pick from flying off my finger. I might try the next size smaller in the future. But this is the best pick I've found for getting a loud, round sound out of my uke.\", \"I absolutely love these!! I bought these colorful wind screens for my karaoke microphones. I have received many compliments from family and friends!! Definitely worth the price. It took a little while to get here, but worth it!! I noticed other reviews stating they didn't get the same colors as pictured. I received the right colors!\", \"I have always hated tuners; I would rather use tuning fork on the A string and go from there. Most tuners are too cumbersome and require large batteries or external power(pedals). In addition I couldn't use those on my acoustics. Snark solves all of these problems.

This one was one continuous piece, and only a few nubs fell out. Ok, lets test it out. I attached it to itself and pressed it together. Nice grip. Then I pulled it apart, and several bunches of nubs came tearing out as well. If I'm going to attach something to my pedal board that will bond permanently, I don't want  something that will tear itself apart and leave bald patches every time I move a pedal.

I just cinch it as much as itll go and its just right.', 'Arrived in 2 days with prime in safe packaging. Minor paint flaws with semi gloss finish. Plywood and plastic construction with painted plastic fretboard. Has plastic tuning keys and metal tuning gears on headstock. Paint wore away quickly on the side of fretboard at the top of the neck. The strings on the ukulele are not of quality but the ukulele can take brand name strings and tune them correctly. The bridge and nut need filing in order to effectively play chords or scales so I would consider it a novelty uke. Perfect for a toddler or young child to use instead of an expensive instrument, but will not be good to learn on or take lessons with. False spruce top and stained mahogany back and sides give it an expensive look that kids will love. Adult supervision required as there are moving parts.

Really really love it! I hope these last long time! Highly recommended! Better effect with a fog machine!', \"This is a great idea and I was surprised at how well the suction cup adheres to my guitar's surface.  However, if you are going to rely on it for a gig, then I would attach at least two as your hand or any brushing against something firm can knock it off.  In other words, it isn't as sticky as adhesive.  But, for most situations, it certainly does the trick and can removed in an instant and does not deface the guitar surface in any fashion.  It does come with a medium thickness, pink pick that is halfway decent.  While I am not crazy about the color, I quickly realized that it is easy to see against the strings and surface of the guitar.\", \"This thing works great. I hooked it up to my ATR2100 along with a NEEWER scissor arm (without a shock mount) and I did some tests to see how my plosives were. It makes a great difference, especially since you have to get pretty close to this type of microphone (dynamic). It may be a cheap buy, but it's definitely quality and does what it needs to.\", \"Gamechanger mixer. One of the few things that has been made in this century that is decent. I use it in a studio rack that replaced a Mackie 1202VLZ, a Yamaha REV500 DSP and a Behringer 31 band DEQ2496. Was a little reluctant to replace all these devices, but over time I gave in as I learned/experimented more with this mixer. I control it with an IPAD Air 2- prefer it over Android as I can place the RTA, the EQ and the channel strip all on the same screen without having to toggle. My only small gripe is that updates and development of the IOS XAir app have not been much of a priority (2 years between 1.42 and 1.5?) . It can be a little overwhelming- after 6 months, I'm still learning more about it and that's a good thing- they'res stuff I can do with this mixer that I could not do with any analogue mixer I've had/used. Love the idea that I can take the IPAD and roam.\", \"All I can say is I'm loving it.\", 'I installed a set of these on my Epiphone G400 Pro. They offer better prevention of guitar straps slipping off than the stock strap buttons provide. These pins also have a lower profile than the stock pins. They are a single piece pin, versus strap lock that have two pieces that lock together. Installation was very easy and the provided hardware fit with no issues. These strap pins give me piece of mind and they look awesome too!', \"This USB guitar/instrument cable lets you connect an electrical musical instrument to a PC directly through the USB port. This takes a few minutes to auto-install the drivers when you plug it in. Once installed it worked smoothly. It seems to be solidly constructed and it fits fine on both the USB plug and the guitar. Take note that it was listed on my computer as a headphone device rather than an instrument cable, so don't get confused by how it is listed in the USB devices. I would say this is worth trying if you want a USB musical instrument cable. I received a discounted sample for my honest, unbiased review.\", \"IMO this is the best and only way to mount toms, especially Pearls.  My Session kit came with them and with the heavy 6 play maple toms have never had a single issue with tuning, bouncing, lug stress whatsoever.  I think after you use them for a while you can take them for granted and don't fully understand how sturdy they are until you use another suspension system.  I recently purchased a Pearl Birch Vision kit for my wife which came with Pearl's I.S.S. mounting system.  To be fair I've never used them, and in the case of the new kit they came right off, and the Optimounts went right on.  Even though these are not the aluminum (more expensive and slightly lighter) Masterworks version, I feel they not only work for what they're intended, but they also accent the drum shells without being intrusive.  Most drummers buy, skin, and play for sound, but showing off your nice wood shells never hurts.  I can't think of a single negative, except that they're not free.  :)\", \"I'm going to give this a five stars.

I have a rack mounted digital recorder, a CD player and a small digital recorder. The 100mkII is also a very good recorder but I have some complaints: The battery life is short maybe because it uses only 2 cells. The volume control is very close to the phone jack making adjustment a bit dificult. The door of the AA cells seems the door of a cheap toy; it could be more robust. Apart from these minor details I'm well satisfied with the product.\", \"These wall hangers are superb. I don't understand why others of inferior quality cots twice as much. These are made out of solid wood (looks like Pinewood) glazed over with weather protective urethane. The great thing about this is that it supports all sizes of guitars, from small Ukuleles to full size. That is due to the rubber rings which they include to avoid smaller necks falling out. Another very nice thing is that the arm is screwed into a wood nut, which makes it super secured while allowing for movement in case you have odd neck shapes (like fender strats) which require a little angle.\", \"Purchased the 5-hole pickguard in eggshell for my MIM Baja Telecaster. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much since I hated the cheap, white plastic version that came stock. Black Bakelite looked good, gold anodized aluminum looked better, but somehow this one just seems right. It's a heavy, vintage thickness, rigid, and very high quality. The eggshell color adds just enough warmth as well. There is no shielding so you may want to slap some copper foil on the back.\", 'Perfect Fit!! Color match is very close.  Great product!! Added pickguard to a Les Paul Studio Deluxe..', 'Good quality for a fair price, but it does indeed sag with heavier weight needs support. I placed 2x20# on the shelf and it sagged about 1/4. Overall a good product. If tasked with supporting small weights, it will likely be a perfect choice.', \"The kit shipped the following day from the distributor after my placing the order, arriving ahead of schedule. It took me a couple of hours to set it up and position the components to my liking. Adjusting the sounds, tones and volume of each device was rather straightforward. For the price, I am pleasantly surprised with the action of the cymbals and pads. Sounds great when recording as well. I highly recommend this kit for someone who doesn't want to spend a fortune, but would like a functional, professional-sounding electronic drum set that can take a beating and not take up a whole lot of space.

It tunes fine. For a long time the tuner just sat in my room, but recently I started taking the tuner around to practice and transporting it in my bag.

I chose the Shu because it seemed to be the most robust to physical abuse and offers varied placement options. I installed on my 16 x 16 inch Pearl Session floor tom conversion and attached an Audix D6--a rather substantial kick drum mic that is hangs pretty heavy toward the front. I got a little creative with the install, attaching all eight leather straps around the circumference of the drum and weaving the rubber cord (full length) back and forth around the Shu (see photos). I used the May no-drill vent hole mic cable adapter to wire it up. I'm very pleased with the design and quality of the Kelly Shu.

I tried adding additional Velcro, but that didn't stop it.  But now, with the Pearl Pedal Stabilizer on the front of it, it stays put.  The Pearl's long spikes go deep into my old oriental carpet that I use as my drum rug at a perfect angle to restrict any forward movement.  Now I can really kick it hard!

It also only came with 2 screws instead of the 4 needed. I had the four screws that came with the guitar anyway, from the plastic jack plate I was replacing, so that was no problem either. The screws were a bit bigger than the intended screws so it gave it a bit more of an industrial look that was unintentional but I think it looks good nonetheless.

I didn't understand they came in different woods so they don't all match.  No matter, they still work well.  I wasn't real sure about the mounting screws that came with them.  However, they have been up a couple of years and no problem at all.  Note, I am not hanging mandolins which are a bit heavier.  I have tenor and soprano ukuleles.

I paired these with a Fender tweed strap, but maybe it is a little bit of overkill having the F sign everywhere (\"Ok ok we KNOW it is a Fender, come on!\"). They are kind of massive when installed, doesn\\'t look bad but just bulky. Only problem I had is that I had previously installed a set of Dunlop straplocks, and when substituting them for these, the new Fender screw fell kind of short, and never got tight, they always stayed turning around when screwing them. So I had to use the previous Dunlop screws with the new Fender ones, and it worked like a charm. Not a problem of the product, but if one has used something else before, one might have these kinds of issues later. Not as easy to lock into the guitar as other models, this one requires two fingers to adjust, instead of for instance Dunlops, with just a central button.

It came in about 4 days immediately and I set it up. Wow the quality is amazing. It extends pretty high and far. I was worried at first it would be too small but it soon proved me wrong. There are no flaws. I will definitely order another one soon for my second mic. This product was great and there's a reason this was rated 5 Stars. Great for home studio budgets.

It definitely needs better strings, but what new instrument doesn't? I haven't tried amplifying it, and I honestly don't plan to, as I only wanted it for the acoustic properties to practice without having to drape myself in cables. The neck is comfortable, the body is well-assembled, and having two strap buttons opposed to the usual single one on most acoustic basses is a welcome feature. The bridge is also very nice: the last acoustic I had, I kept losing bridge pins, so not having to deal with those was a main drawing point for this bass for me.\", 'Looks great on my sons fender acustic!

I asked him if there was anything negative about it and he said all he can think of is how perfect it is.  You can adjuster mic volume, very clear, he has not heard any cut outs.

This guitar is VERY playable--fits well in my hands and has nice low action. I really like the sound it puts out and it DOES stay in tune contrary to the negative comments I read to the contrary.

I read comments saying that the green wire goes with the red and the white is hot. Mine came with the red wire as hot, and I didn't change that. It works, and it definitely sounds like a beige pickup is supposed to, so it think you should just trust whatever setup the factory gives you. Also, I know other people explained this, but many said they had to enlarge the pickup hole to accommodate the pickup. You DO NOT. It takes a bit of patience but if you are careful, you can slip it in with no modifications.if you are looking to upgrade a cheap guitar, you should be pretty well satisfied with this pickup.\", \"I put these knobs on my squire strat, my epi sg, and an off brand strat.

I did kind of dent the inside of a gold one as I put it on my squire, so you do have to be careful when installing.

Pop's (when fresh) is the stickiest. Nyman is hard and powdery. Kolstein is very sticky and there is almost no powder at all. There is something special in their formulation. I believe Kolstein includes wax in their rosin recipe, which keeps dust from forming. The other benefit of Kolstein is that it lasts for a very long time on the shelf. Pop's will dry out in less than 2 years. Some people will only use Pop's for a few months before throwing it away. I go back and forth between Kolstein and Pop's. I still can't decide which is my favorite. But them both and try it out.\", \"So far so good. Never heard of Lazarro and who cares? The saxophone can perform. The brand doesn't matter.

Mine came with Lazarro reeds 2 1/2 strength and now I use D'Addario Select Jazz reeds 3S and it does the trick.  If you know how to take care of the saxophone it'll last. Well worth the investment.

I tried some no-drill straps, but ultimately chose to add a strap button with no problem. I saw some reviews about quality control issues on the finish, and I did find a rough spot on the back (see photo). This was not an issue for me, but I'd suggest checking for this.

Great if you want to do some recording in an area that is not sound treated that you can't get away with using a condenser microphone in.

They do sound okay but nothing special. Look pretty cool too but looks aren\\'t what\\'s getting it done. Overpriced in my opinion as are most fender cables. Not a huge fan and prefer lower profile pancake type patch cables mogami sounds better , easier to work with and the pedals can be kept much neater and closer to save space. That means room for \"more toys!\" Hooked a few pedals together off the board and took a couple pics so you can get an idea of the tension and overall in my opinion sloppy fit of these cables.', \"This is not a sturdy stand. This is probably not suitable for a school band room. It is a lightweight, foldable and easily stashed stand that barely holds a three ring binder with 50 pages of fake tab.

There seems to be plenty of padding (high density Styrofoam?).  In regards to the various sizes, I bought the \"Electric\" size and it fits my new Fender Strat perfectly.  A Fender Strat fits snugly without shifting around.  NOTE:  If you have a Les Paul style guitar, make sure to buy the \"Les Paul\" case.  If you buy this Electric case, which is what I am reviewing here,  your Les Paul will NOT fit!  Inside the case there are a couple of areas where you can put a couple of effects pedals, etc.  If you use mini-pedals, you might be able to fit four.  On the outside there is a large, zippered pocket that will fit a small laptop.  Plus, another zippered pocket that has see-thru mesh material.  The zippers are large and heavy duty.

They work with Schallers so you don't have to worry about compatibility and I guess they'll be covered up when I'm playing out, so it's not really that big of a deal but I'm still kind of disappointed. They're also quite a bit bigger but I'm not sure if I hate this, obviously I'm used to smaller Schallers however the larger washer means a more secure connection with my strap and more gold flair. I dunno, I'm still too disappointed with the discoloration.\", \"Awesome bass. I love it. As some other reviewers have commented this bass is not balanced as a standard solid body bass. the neck is definitely heavier due to the hollow body, but you know, that's the way it goes. I love the sound the hollow body gives you sounds a bit like my acoustic bass. The controls give a nice variety of sounds. I am something of a novice player but wanted to add a hollow body bass to my small collection and this Hofner replica is just the ticket. I think I might replace the strings that it came with as they sound a too metallic for my taste, but they are playable and hold tune well. I was able to play this bass right out of the box once I tuned it. No need for adjusting and didn't have that fret buss some reviewers have commented on. I did notice the neck is slimmer and the strings are closer together than any of my other basses, so that is an adjustment, but didn't take long to get into the swing of things. Fun to play and lightweight. Recommended.\", 'Mine were very stiff and hard to tune, no smoothness, like there was dirt or grit in the gears.  After installing one of the tuning keys got super stiff and before I could get up to tune the head snapped off.  Had to return entire set...pain in the azz.

This thing is incredible for attaching a wah to a pedalboard. I just wish they made something just like this for all of my pedals. It's so much more secure than the sticky back stuff.\", \"This pair of Samson GT Studio Monitors was a great start for me, they aren't your loudest speakers, but they still pack a punch. They can still be mixed on, and give a good all around frequency response. What you want to be careful of is the bass, and mixing bass on these because they will not provide all of the bass that is really there. They are great for mids. The portability is amazing! Along with the fact that you will NOT need an audio interface with these! The Mic plugs directly into the speaker! What a easy and accessible way for an artist to record his vocals, or for a guitarist to to record his notes. Definitely a good investment!\", \"This box does everything I need it to. It's passive, so it doesn't color the sound, it makes for easy switching between my two sets of monitors, and even has an auxiliary input (RCA connection) with separate volume control (which I use to patch in an xbox. Gotta take 5 from working every once in a while!). The main volume knob is really smooth and has some slight resistance, which makes it feel great when dialing in levels.\", \"Deep tone and I'm a fan!\", \"These speakers sound great! I've had a pair of cube Auratone reference monitors for 30 yrs that still sound great but these iLouds are another level. Strong bass, crystal clear mids and highs. They are computer speakers on steroids! The pairing of inboard amp matched perfectly with the drivers makes sure you are getting great sound. They are Bluetooth capable too which I didn't even notice at first because it isn't stated loudly on the package. They aren't inexpensive but neither are good microphones and guitars. If you can afford the price, you will be pleased. Luckily my girlfriend gave me mine for Christmas :) Thank You Love!\", \"Great value for a hard case, holds lots of guitars, including jaguar, or even a Les Paul. Only issue is... that there's not enough padding,  and some guitars might knock around if You don't add some additional support.\", 'I Fit 9 Guitars in this. The 2 outside Pads Support 2 more on Stage! It was Cheap compared to Most Stands that Cost $75.00 to $100.00', \"Fits my AT2035 like a glove.

Mine has expanded nicely in just an afternoon. Doubt if there's much better for my mic at the same price. Highly recommend.\", \"I like this little small light! It fits in your hand and is a decent output of light. It is dmx which we all know is awesome! Dmx makes the world a little easier to control! The colors are red green blue and white. The only thing I do not like is the way the colors are mixed, you can see the outside of the color when you mix them. I would put one quad led in the fixture so it's all under one lense and there's no bleeding. But other than that this fixture is awesome!\", \"I've used this for 3 years every Halloween and it always has worked well for me.  After each use, I rinse the tank out with distilled water, then run the unit until just steam comes out, then I dump the water and store the unit dry.  I've heard of people who think you should store the units full of fog juice, but I've heard of people who say the pump gets gunky if you do that.\", \"This stereo audio jack splitter worked smoothly for me, allowing me to connect 2 headphones to one audio output and also to connect an audio output from a music keyboard to a PC and headphones simultaneously.

It can go from clean to pretty dirty but if you really want to get nasty you will need a nice hot humbucker and a distortion pedal.

The little tube in the preamp does really make it sound good.', 'Tried a number of noise gates, including the EHX silencer.  This one blows them all away.

Got all the terminals soldered together and mounted the crossover right to the plate, and everything seems to work just fine.', 'Many people think that a electric guitar for around 100 bucks is cheap and sounds terrible. this guitar makes that opinion wrong. this guitar is amazing for the price. the first part of the guitars character you notice is the beautiful red color. it looks beautiful and is really eye catching. the playability is nice with a good action. the strings it comes with are decent factory strings but i changed them anyway for better sound. the volume and tone knobs are cool looking also. the tune o matic bridge helps alot and kept my guitar in tune for days. this guitar also comes with a amp cable , some papers, owners guide, a poster and a big epiphone sticker. who doesnt love stickers? lol. i highly recommend this guitar to beginners and those who have been playing for a while. the sound quality is amazing for the price you get.', \"This is my absolute favorite guitar strap amongst those I've purchased.  I'm using it with an antique German lute guitar (wandervogellaute), and the stained glass pattern complements the carved rosette of the sound hole in a vaguely ecclesiastical motif -- while still looking a little hippie.  The lute guitar is extremely lightweight, so I can't speak to how well the strap would hold up a heavy solid body electric guitar, but it seems to be very sturdily made, and is definitely comfortable.\", 'I really like the simplicity of this bridge. It adjusts easy for string height and length. It comes with all the mounting screws and even a small allen wrench to make the height adjustments. The provided mounting screws are Phillips head screws. The one thing that I missed when I ordered this was the fact that it is not a bridge for string-thru the guitar body placement. The strings dead end to the stop-flair of the plate. I included a picture of this so it may help to make others aware that it is not for string-thru applications. No biggie tho for me, I will use it on another project now.', 'They are nice picks but much smaller than they appear in your photos!', \"Perfect fit on my 2016 Gibson Les Paul Studio Faded.  I didn't like the original speed knobs because they were too big and clunky-feeling.

I was pleasantly surprised to see the one thing I disliked about mine had been changed. The mount that attaches to your desk has received an upgrade, allowing for a tighter fit on the boom arm stalk, and a more robust build of the mount overall. My previous mount had a D-shaped hole the boom arm stalk slipped into, which allowed for a lot of movement regardless of how tight you made the clamping screw. It was also equipped with an oversized plastic wingnut for securing the mount to the desk. The upgraded mount rectifies both those issues.', \"I received this pedal as a gift.  A compressor is a subtle effect, but it has made a great addition to my pedal board.  The construction of the pedal is solid.  It adds character to chords and enhances leads.  I am currently using the pedal with the sustain at 1 o'clock, the attack at noon, and the volume at 10 o'clock.  The volume provides a very strong boost after 11 o'clock.  Overall, good pedal for the price.\", 'I wanted something light and compact that can hold a few items, but also fit well in a carry-on and protect the jamstik indoors or out. This case is the perfect solution, and has a nice, adjustable strap as well. Good  durable construction and love having the jamstik label to show it off!', 'This was a great value. The wood I received looked outstanding and all the parts were there and fit well. I did some customization to the look and added a couple of other pickups for some diversity but the components I received were of reasonable quality. The guitar looks and plays great after a bit of neck adjustment and setup. Very satisfied.', 'There are only a few things I needed to know before I purchased this Alto/Tenor stand.  1.  Did it hold my Tenor and Soprano properly? 2.  Would this particular stand work properly on different surfaces? 3.  Is the design portable and easy for setup for gigs/home use to easily swap for doubled soprano?', 'Never levelled frets before I picked this thing up. The concept seemed simple enough. I figured that, due to the weight of this block, little to no pressure would be required and that was a good call.', \"This is a very nice Crash / Ride Cymbal.

I need to get a new, daisy chain chord, so I can use all my pedals at once, but I have no noise issues (those who do have ground loop issues). I also used a pen to push in the two pedal flap hinge pins to remove it and expose the battery compartment.

It timely arrived. The center mike holder opening is for a much larger microphone than the ATR 2100, that I own. The 2100 indicates 51mm, but that is at the mike area, not the trunk which is much smaller and used for mounting to the shock mount. After researching a replacement in the same price range, I found none. I had some foam pipe insulation for 1/2 inch pvc pipe in the utility room. This is readily available from most any big box hardware store.  I cut the foam about 4\" in length and placed the 2100 in the foam. It fits perfect. I didn\\'t seal the foam, but it is just right and tight in the mount holder. I now have a shock mount that can be used if, and when, I purchase a larger microphone. I have attached a photo.

Strap itself is really soft, so it doesn't irritate your shoulders and neck while you're playing your guitar. It adjusts pretty easy to your desired length. Buckle is plastic. You may or may not have an issue with that. I personally didn't. It looks amazing, and that's putting it kindly. I've gotten many compliments on it already. Definitely worth the money.

I read one review in which the guy was not satisfied because he said it sounded like \"80\\'s glam rock.\" I totally disagree. If you can play and have a decent amp - you can get a variety of great sounds out of this little box. It seems like so many players like a fuzzy, buzzy type overdrive sound.

It did take some time to dial in the right mix and level.  I personally do not use the chorus and vibrato, but it does add a cool later to the sound.  The delay is very good and natural sounding.  This pedal is a great alternative to similar pedals that are much more expensive.', 'Extremely impressed with this kit.', \"(Review is based on using it with the PYLE PSMRS11 Acoustic Isolation Microphone shield, you can buy it as a package. I bought mine separately) It is one heavy duty mic stand, but I got it for holding up the PYLE PSMRS11 Acoustic Isolation Microphone shield and the damn shield was too heavy to hold in place!  It kept falling over. This mic stand was sold to hold the darn thing but it only works if you place the Isolation Shield in a certain direction (see picture). You must remove the rubber pads that are on the Microphone shield, if you don't you'll find your Isolation shield on the floor! The weight is too heavy for the rubber pads to hold them up (they are glued on). So you have to tighten metal to metal to hold the shield in place. You have to constantly check the tightening supports to make sure they don't pull the support stand down with it! You also have to remove the bottom metal desk supports from the Mic Shield to lighten the load on the Mic Stand. I hope this helps everyone using this for a Mic Shield.\", 'NICE..

This homemade CBG sounds like a legitimate strat. I would definitely use this pickup again in the future, and I have no doubt it would sound good to swap out the pups on a cheapo commercial strat with these. My only complaint, and it's a small one, is that the knobs included had a tiny bit of smearing on the gold paint. It's not a big deal because many pups don't include knobs at all, and there are so many knob options available at very affordable prices.

That guy was 100% correct! I just popped out the existing mounting ring with a flat blade and my V67G slipped right in and could be tighly secured using the black mounting ring supplied with the V67G.', 'I play both guitar and ukulele. I bought the chord stamps for both instruments. How nice to be able to make note of unfamiliar chords, easily, right on my music. Saves me from having to constantly look them up. I highly recommend these. Get you some! ;-)', 'great item for holding all those guitars', \"For the money they are good strings as far as I can tell. I didn't test them side by side with the more expensive strings, but for my playing frequency these seem to do just fine.\", 'Beautiful cables, works great, no loss of connection. Very good price for two XLR cables', 'This is a beautiful capo, and with the action on my guitar I can use it anywhere after moving it a bit, a five star product', 'Worked Great in my kit build.  Had to enlarge the holes a tiny bit as they are ever so slightly larger then the stock that came with the kit.  They still stand a tad proud of the bridge but they do hold the strings well and it makes them easier to remove.  They look fantastic, great buy for the money.', \"Used this for my Ron Wood ESP/LTD. I love me skme humbuckers, and this did just the trick. Put a black pickguard on it too so its black on black. I dug how Ryan Key's looked. Dont delay and buy it!\", \"Great pics, slip in your hand if you're not careful tho\", \"I own one, candy apple red, and it's everything you'd expect from a guitar that was built to Eric's specs. No joke. Jus got it signed by EJ recently. ;)\", 'Love it!!! Would buy again!', 'I needed something to put a karaoke monitor on out front of my DJ setup and on a whim went looking around for a VESA mount for a mic stand. Found one, but also found this, which is 10 times better! This stand is GREAT! It is heavier duty than my speaker stands and the legs when fully opened will stabilize the biggest  monitor you reasonable would put on a VESA mount that size. The small 17\" one I have on it solid. It is hard to tell in the photo but the mic holders do have a slot on the side so wired as well as wireless mikes can slip in, you\\'ll want to use a round head Shure 58 or equivalent so it doesn\\'t fall through. Like others have said the hardware is top notch, adjustments can be tightened down securely, and the monitor and its adapter can be taken off with just 2 thumb screws for transport. Great deal at the 70 price too!', 'The arm is extremely short and should be longer', 'This one is much more stable than the brand they have at my music studio.  I like this one way better.  The platform is wider and my foot seems much happier.  Yes, it costs more, but it was worth it for me.  Very happy with the purchase.  And it lays flat for easy storage.', 'Small but powerful enough. It is well made, pretty basic for a speaker.  I would probably buy another one.', 'I gave a cheaper neck a shot. I am blown away by the look of this neck. The stain used is just enough to highlight the grain nicely and the clear coat is darn near perfect. I figured a lot of time would be during the \"adjustment\" phase of the build. Nothing else had to be done once the neck was set and bolted on. What a pleasant surprise since in past builds I\\'d spent an hour or more getting them set. I\\'ve used Fender and Warmoth before that cost 3 times and more than this one. The proof had been in the pudding though. This neck has been on this guitar for over a year now. No problems. I use this guitar as a back up and play it quite frequently on gigs. I buy more!', 'This is a fantastic rack and makes my home studio look really professional.', 'Nice tuners.  Installed on a strat neck and they are working great. Nice and smooth and has stayed in tune very well. Nothing wrong with these.', \"Awesome stand. Best one I've ever had. It's not that heavy easy to carry in maneuver. The push adjustment for the up-and-down is great quick and easy holds really good. Feels like it's going to last a long time without being overly heavy. I really have no complaints thing works great. I did put a counterweight cuz my tube recording mic is kind of heavy.. wish I could buy 20 for 50 bucks. Wish they had a deal for multiple...\", 'I was surprised of the quality of this mic. I used it for recording sessions and sounded clean. I would definitely recommend to anyone to purchase this product. I did not use the unbalanced cable it came with because I had balanced cables that were better to use.', 'Nice guitar.', 'I just tested this fog fluid with a 1byone 400W fogger. Two 30 second bursts were sufficient to create enough fog layers for a moody atmosphere in a 2 car garage. This being a hot space I was pleasantly surprised by how long the fog would linger. It would quickly rise to eye level and then just hang there. Another nice surprise was the odor- there is not much of it, but if you step in the middle of a thick pocket it smells like lavender (?) soap.', 'Unfortunately I received plastic pins with black dots. Not happy and have to return them.', 'Cable quality is great, as usual from monoprice. However, Monoprice used a very sticky tape that left a huge amount of tape-glue on the cable rather than two twist ties or similar..Went through 10 minutes and 3 clorox wipes getting it all (mostly) off. Unusual for them.', \"Just got my pedal board yesterday!  I love it.  Before I had my pedals strewn all over the floor.  Now they're organized and easier to use.  The board is larger than I expected b/c I didn't pay attention to the measurements in the description.  But I'm glad I chose this one.  It gives me an excuse to purchase more pedals.  Obviously the stock photo shows many pedals placed really close together which is not realistic considering the cables that are involved.  I'm attaching photos of my board for better reference.  Eventually, as I add more pedals I will place the power supply under the board, but for now I like the blue illumination of the AGP power supply.\", \"This was supposed to be red tortoise.  It's actually closer to brown tortoise.  Maybe in between red and brown but certainly not what I consider red tortoise. I actually have another guitar in need of a brown tortoise cover so I'm using it on that one so not that big a deal, however will not work on my intended red tortoise guitar.  I've attached pic of the this cover which is on the guitar on the left.  The one on the right is what I consider a proper red tortoise.\", \"Overall I'm happy with the stand.  I admit I was scratching my head a bit when I was putting it together.  There's more pieces to this stand than others I've had.  Adjusting it is a little bit of a pain because there are 4 different areas that you can loosen and change around.  If you travel and gig a lot, you may want to go with the higher model, the adjustments look a bit easier.  However once all setup, it's sturdy and well built.\", \"Great price and good quality.  It didn't quite match the radius of my sound hole but it was close enough.\", \"I have a garage sale piece of junk MIJ hollowbody that I've used Amazon to build for cheap.  It's been a blast and this fit the bill perfectly.\", \"A great product if you need to connect a guitar to a computer or other USB compatible recording device. The cord is incredibly well made. I would say this is for home-use or hobby recording. It would be wonderful to be used to save song ideas or songs in the making. The connections work just fine and are well made. The cord is nice and long so it's comfortable to sit or stand and play and not feel too attached to a computer. The connection points are nice and sturdy so they won't break. If you are in the market for one of these types of guitar cables, I do recommend this one.\", 'So i needed a cheap guiar that i could bang into walls and not care, so i got this thinking it would be perfect for the job. Sadly, i fell in love with it even though they sent me the wrong guitar. (Amazon falsely advertised it). I got the brown sunburst (absolutely beautiful) but instead of a white puckguard, i got brown sparkly one. Oh well $10 and 30 minutes later and i can fix that. Anyway. It sounds great for a $125 and plays amazingly.', 'I put these in a new bass I built last week.', 'Outstanding case!  My H6 fits into this case perfectly.  It is made of heavy duty plastic, which is at least twice as thick at the case that comes with the H6.  Each cut-out within the foam interior is custom sized to fit your H6 and all of the accessories.  The latches are very sturdy.  See picture to get a sense of the size in relation to the standard H6 case.  BUY IT...', 'These really tidy up my practice board. I like the little donner pedals and these chain them nicely. I do Velcro them down so at some point Ill have to deal with taking stuff apart but.... oh well.', \"Absolutely awesome cables for the money. I've bought a number of these in different colors. The connectors are really decent and the cables are very well made- nice silicone jacket.  I've shortened a number of these LyxPro cables using the original ends for balanced line use in a patch bay.and also using, Neutrix TRS connectors, Neutric XLR's, Switchcraft right angle TRS ends, and even some ends of off some Seismic Audio cables.\", 'I have worked in radio for over 12 years as well as voiceover.  My main microphone has been the big brother to this one.  Most radio studios you enter use the RE20.  That being said when I recieved this RE 320 I was blown away.  I have done my radio show with it exclusively for the past 8 months and love it!  This mic ROCKS!  This microphone has XLR connections so be sure to use good mixer with those standard connections for a top quality mic like this.  When you first get this microphone you immediately notice the professional look and feel to it.  It is all that you would imagine it to be. Simply put this mic is top quality and produces great sound even without processing.  5 STARS!', 'Light is bright, light weight, and small in size. Works great in auto mode and sound activated mode. This light almost goes 360 degrees, and will easily fill a backyard or small hall.', \"The Ditto is the best looper I've owned (I've tried a few). It's very easy to use.\", \"Cool little box, I'm using it with my Arturia Microbrute analog synth, looks cool, sound good, easy to use, fits well in gig bag.\", 'Installed these humbuckers on my Epiphone Les Paul Standard. The sound of the neck and bridge humbuckers are very similar. The bridge just has a tad bit more treble. However, both of these HBs produce a very, very warm sound. When playing with an MXR Distortion + it produces a grunge/fuzz sound but keeps clarity of each note. The clarity is outstanding on the HBs-each note can be heard. The HBs are not very versatile, only producing a grunge/fuzz sound, regardless of what distortion pedal I use but it fits my playing style at the moment so I am very happy with them.', \"If you're looking for a gig bag for a semi-hollow guitar or bass, this will do the job. Make sure you are looking for part number 0991622206 - that's the Metro Gig Bag for Semi Hollow basses.\", \"This case is awesome!  The molded interior fits my Fender Jazz Bass like a glove and I feel it's secured at all times.  This is the second case I've owned and the quality is superb!  It balances much better in my hand while carrying it than my last case which was a bit front heavy.  It's also lighter in weight than my previous case too.  The open compartment is deep enough to fit my cable, strap, tuner, accessories and I usually throw my amp power cable in there too.  I also like that the open compartment does not have a door that you always have to open or close.  Just open the case and everything is there for easy access.  Lastly, cosmetically this case is very sweet looking.  The black, white and chrome details are perfect and of course the chrome Fender logo on the top of the case really sets it off.\", 'These sticker pentagrams are real nice. Have some left over and put them on my violin. Badass.', 'I installed this kit in my Squier by Fender Vintage Modified Stratocaster. What a great upgrade. The guitar comes with all those tiny pots and cheap electronics. Get yourself one of these kits if your guitar came with cheap electronics. It is a Tone Buster... :) PS I added a few other mods myself.', \"I wanted gold jacks, not silver. I've built a Steeler-themed guitar (see photo) and these silver jacks are wrong. Will you exchange it for the gold jacks?\", 'Works as advertised (I\\'m sure along with the other 5 or 6 brands out there that are the exact same one- see pic it\\'s the one they shipped). Only thing I\\'d say is pay attention to your current- everything worked fine except my wireless (line 6). It\\'d power up but then go dark. Turns out it was plugged into a 100ma port. It needs upwards of 300+ma. Plugged into the correct port and it was fine. So far no issues after about 6 or 7 gigs. I\\'m surprised because it\\'s priced so cheap. Comes with all the barrel (power) cords (Not the 1/4\" cords). Can\\'t go wrong for under $40.', \"I have a 1986 Peavey Patriot made in the usa guitar. It had one cheap string tree that wasn't a roller. These work great! Make sure to drill the holes for any of these trees you are going to install. The included screw cannot handle the pressure of screwing it in. I will add pictures soon. You won't be disappointed. They add incredible sustain to my guitar!\", \"First of all, I am a HUGE Fender fan. Guitars, amps and especially their pickups.  Second, when it comes to tone, I am very picky. I love the Fender Custom Shop 69s, 54s, 57/62s and Fat 50s. I wanted to try something other than Fender this time, so I chose these SSL-1s. So far I think they are absolutely the best single coil pickup I have ever had. Big, full tone with bell-like highs and a clear bottom end.  On a lot of pickups in Strats the neck pickup can sound too quacky, too much twang and it over powers everything else.  These strike a very nice balance with quack and all the other harmonics that are present.  Some other vintage single coils Ive tried have too much chimey-ness in the tone, too much high, drowns out the mids, again these SSL-1s don't do that, even though there is still tons of chimey, bell-like tones, like glass breaking, very brilliant, but its balanced out with the mid and low tones as well.  Very nice and yes I would buy them again.\", \"At the Price point and what it deliveres it's a must buy. I play Bass. Only a few things I can gripe about and it's the clarity of the notes not being as clear and the split with the music (aux) and headphones..gotta find the right spot. That said it's built great for plastc...very sturdy..and the fact I can USE AAA batteries and not LITHIUM BUILT IN is what sold me over others too! (Buy your own batteries)  Comes with cheap batteries. The device works so well I can change two batteries but if the built in stop working and it fades away.. device is no good. Nobody knows I'm evening practicing or jamming. Very nice should have baught along time ago. I use Beats headphones and Uiisii Us90 ear buds sold on Amazon..the best earbuds you will find!($10!) Find them!  Why the Beats? I use the cord for aux to phone. But u can get an aux cord ..(preference)\", \"Fits my Squier Stratocaster (Bullet) great, with a few inches to spare lengthwise.  Theres a ton of great zipper pockets, the handles are great and the padding is pretty decent. I use this for light traveling for my cheaper guitars. In my opinion I would not put an expensive guitar in here as the padding isn't the best, but it will still resist scratches and small bangs but more than likely not drops.\", \"5 stars. For its price and size, couldn't have asked for more.\", \"Love it! I have had other tuners & recently bought a pedal tuner. I like this because it's much more convenient. The pedal wears through 9 volt batteries pretty quick, so I'm constantly plugging & unplugging.

For the price, it's hard to see why anyone would settle for cheaper.  The stand is stable and locks the guitar to the stand at the head stock. The locking mechanism senses weight and locks the guitar in place without extraneous adjustments.\", 'Ordered a \"MUGIG\" tuner, but received one with a \"Musedo\" brand mark. (See photo) Who is \"Musedo\", anyway?! I\\'m sure I\\'m correct in my assumption that these inexpensive tuners are mass-produced in China and receive all manner of brand name logos on them.', \"This is now the second pop filter I have purchased of this brand, and there has been one significant upgrade that I am jealous that my previous purchase of item didn't have. I have been setting up two separate recording PC's at home, and my son wanted a similar setup as I had. The first filter I had purchased still works and I liked its ease of use. I was pleasantly surprised to see the one thing I disliked about mine had been changed.\", 'I like these things. Bought 12 of them and Never had a problem. They come with drywall mounts as well as stud screws.  I always put into studs. Mutch safer than lots of stands that can fall over. Great price and solid.', 'These were perfect in every way for my application.  I installed these on a MIM stratocaster (I had to drill three holes in the tremolo plate to do so) and they were the correct NARROW string width ( 2 - 1/16\" ) for my application.  I was even able to top-load the strings through the holes where the intonation screws originally fed through, just to piss off the purists.  It worked so well that I am doing the same modification to another of my import strats, but this time with graph tech saddles.  Those ones will work as well, but I have to sand off some injection mold flaws first (although that will be easy as well).  I\\'m a believer in either brass or graphite when it comes to the break-angles of strings and these were literally perfect.', \"First of all these lights look great! The flashing patterns and bright lights really add pazaz to a party or get together as long as the lights are dimmed of course. The LX-5 has a built-in microphone which is used to match up the light flashes to the beat of a song playing, and this works very well as long as your speakers have a subwoofer (built in or external). I listened to some dubstep tracks while using this and I couldn't believe how accurate it was! The lights alternated between each color during the climb, and flashed in a unison strobe at the drop!\", 'I\\'m writing several different reviews here on Amazon to inform all of the shoppers that ALL of the low priced scissor arm mic stands on Amazon right now are the exact same model, just branded with the different logo. I actually picked up the \"neewer\" brand one because it said it came with an integrated XLR cable and a shock mount, but it did NOT, even when I exchanged it for another. Even the box said it has those accessories, but none were included.', 'The fender modern player stratocaster is a great guitar, I bought this guitar and modified it with chrome pickup covers and chrome knobs, it is a great looking and great sounding, I strongly recommend this guitar.', 'Absolutely amazing! I think they are direct knock-off of Seymour Duncan SH-2 Jazz Model Humbucker Pickups. (you can see the same little holes on each of pups) Powerful, bright sound, no noise. My old Johnson LP with ex \"EMG-ish\"  pickups are now fully awake and angry in a good way. Great quality! Thanks everyone for good review.', \"Thickest and most durable beater patch on the market. Buy this even if you don't use Aquarian heads. It'll prolong the life of any head!\", \"I recently got a used, but excellent, Epiphone Junior.  I've been playing for over fifty years and owned many -- many quite fine, costly, guitars. But as others have discovered, these older, P90-equipped Epis belie their cost. They play and sound GREAT.  With one exception: They come with pretty poor tuners.\", \"I have both Teles and Strats, and they both rite in this case perfectly. The extra storage areas are great, and you don't get outside storage pockets on a hard case.  The case is very well made, durable, and light.  I think the price for this product is a very good value. I know this will suit my needs perfectly!\", \"These are not bad for the price and have a good feel to them weight wise. I would say beginner sticks for sure but once you get to be a better drummer and you are learning how to make different sounds with your kit like a rim shot. These will snap off fast.

I love these for their color and overall aesthetics.', 'This is great. I bought for another reason but used it instead on my hihat and removed the legs which it is meant to do. Its more solid than with legs and less clutter. Now I have to buy another for the original purpose. I love it.', 'I\\'ve been using this little amp for over a month now and totally love it.  I run it into a small cabinet with a Jensen Vintage C8R4 8-inch ceramic speaker housed in a maple 12\" x 12\" cabinet and it sounds amazing.  If you closed your eyes you would think you were hearing a Fender Tweed combo from the 50\\'s.  I use a delay/reverb combo pedal in the effects loop insert and it\\'s as sweet as the larger setups I have in my main music room.  I use this in my office and it\\'s perfect for the space.  I can\\'t believe such vintage tones can come out of a chip-amp that is as small as a stomp pedal.  If you\\'re looking for extremely high gain, try one of the other Hotone amps like the Legacy British Invasion or Purple Wind.', \"Monster grips are a necessity for guitarists and bassists who demand that their pick has a grippy surface! They adhesive on them is very strong and will stick to picksp made of any material. I use them on carbon fiber picks, bone picks, brass pics & horn picks.

The neck was straight and even had the correct relief; frets were smooth and will require only minimum hand rolling of the ends. This one had the correct strat heel shape.  It is a beautiful fretboard with lots of character; the inexpensive nut was the right height and easy enough to replace.

Or with running a DI into the sound board for the same reason.  So I ordered this pickup from Amazon and installed it.  I ran it through a small Crate combo amp (XT65R); it was plenty loud - in fact I\\'ll be cutting it back tonight.

One black set and the other is gold. The first guitar would not stay in tune so I tried these. They have been on for nearly a year now and they totally fixed my tuning problem. The second set I put on my brand new Gibson Les Paul only because the first ones worked so well. Super easy fast string changes with the auto trim feature, and no tuning issues at all. At 18:1 gear ratio they dial in a perfect tune and hold it. I prefer these over Grover or any other higher priced tuners available.\", 'Superb built quality and sound.

The plastic part that the nylon strap is looped through broke clean off, right on stage. Luckily it was right at the end of a song as I played the last chord, and I held onto the guitar so it didn't go crashing down on the stage. But it could have, I was just lucky. Where the strap loops onto the plastic mechanism is the weak link. The locking part is a good idea. Not going to trust this thing with my instruments though. I had an old Ernie Ball spare strap in my case with simple leather ends. I will use it from now on.\", \"This guitar is far more beautiful in person. The red to gold tones blend so wonderfully and it has a barely visible tiger-stripe/wood pattern effect that I hadn't noticed prior to purchasing it. I got it here for a fraction of the price I was finding it other places. I have had no problems with it whatsoever yet, it plays easily and sounds like I spent a lot more on it than I did. It even arrived sooner than was expected.\", \"Great cup holder. Very sturdy, easy to clamp on a Pearl cymbal stand, hasn't moved through 50+ hours of rehearsal and performances.\", 'Fits 8 Chauvet Slimpar 64 RGBA, power cords, DMX board and paperwork in front pouch and misc. supplies in end pouches and nothing is tight. This bag is made very well and has heavy duty zippers. It has 10 dividers that Velcro in and can be moved. The bottom velcros in too for nice padding. At first the bag seemed short inside so I removed the bottom and placed it in properly to get the right height. It also has a nice shoulder strap. Finally a great product. I am now a Phitz fan!', 'I purchased this kit to have an organized and efficient way of changing my guitar strings (electric and acoustic). I like that the tools are all organized in one pouch, there are slots for string set(s), so that you never have to worry about being unprepared for a guitar emergency (hence the name \"gig\" mate).', \"the anouncement says original fender, but i recieved a emerson pot inside a simple plastic bag, and without the tonecapacitor .... I don't like it.  :( :( :(\", 'As a \"Starter\"\" guitar or as a legit back-up it\\'s hard to beat the LP-100 for the price.  I was a complete newb when I bought this model 5 months ago - took it to a friend who\\'s been playing for 30 years and he was really impressed with everything about it.  As a result of having such a good time learning on this one I upgraded 3 weeks ago to an Epiphone Les Paul Standard Red Royale Model.  I got the LP-100 back out last night for the heck of it and am Still impressed with it. Had thought about selling it when I got the new Epi LP but I think now I will hold on to it awhile!!  I purchased Black with cream colored trim then swapped out some of the trim for black and blue', 'They were perfect! Man i love them....', \"When I first pulled this out of the box I was pleasantly surprised. There were quite a few negative reviews, so I was half expecting  it to arrive in pieces. But it was packaged well and already assembled, so I was pretty happy. Once I had it installed on my rack, I noticed the cable holes in the back aren't even punched out! The main reason I bought this was to store my noisy external hard drive.  I can't do that now, so I guess this drawer is just going to hold random crap that I have on my desk.  I'm honestly pretty bummed. I was tempted to give this two stars, but the drawer itself is pretty acceptable for the price. If you don't need to run cables through the back of it,  then I don't see any reason this wouldn't work for you.\", \"Its a pick holder. It does what its supposed to. I mainly use Fender medium picks, and have a few Fender heavy picks around. I don't have any thin picks. Itll hold 6 heavy picks or 9 medium picks. I would imagine it would hold 11 or 12 thin picks.\", 'I took me some time to get set right, now I really like it.', 'I use this with an&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/On-Stage-MY550-Microphone-Extension-Attachment-Bar/dp/B0002ZO3LK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">On Stage MY550 Microphone Extension Attachment Bar</a>&nbsp;to mount the mics that come in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Nady-DMK-5-Drum-Mic-Package/dp/B0002GXUMW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Nady DMK-5 Drum Mic Package</a>.

This is probably because it was damaged when received. The knobs where also scratched when received. Luckily I had a spare input jack.', 'Awesome thumb pic!', \"I find this unit adequate, I use it with my MacBook as part of a portable 'winter' studio. I also own a Scarlet 2i2 (Gen 1)  which I use in my primary studio  I find the 2i2 has superior sound quality  less audible distortion / lower noise  and I prefer the 2i2's Neutrik style XLR/TRS output connector. The Behringer is a good value  it works fine and has good features / performance for the price  but like other Behringer products I've used, the sound quality / noise / distortion, leave me wanting a better product. If features or budget are at the top of your list, this product should do the job; if however sound quality is of primary importance then I'd recommend the Scarlet 2i2 (look for sales or a used Gen 1).\", \"I love how this baby sounds! It has a nice full loud sound. Tones are just right! Its better looking than the pictures they give you. I no its an Epiphone but I would play this guitar anywhere! I have several guitars but I can't set this baby down! I have Grover locking gold tuners that will go right on!\", \"Love the blue glow of the power supply on my pedal board.  I've only had it for a day so I don't know how it will hold up, but i'm sure it will be fine.  Comes with all of the cables to fully power your pedal board.  The A/C adapter cable is only 3 feet long so consider buying an extension chord or power strip to plug it into.\"]\n"
